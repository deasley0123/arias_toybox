    You came home from work to your small studio apartment, changed into sweatpants, 
    grabbed a drink from the fridge and sat on the floor in front of your TV because
    it was more comfortable than your shitty IKEA couch.

    You flipped through channels and eventually settled on a network game show you remembered 
    watching with your grandmother when you were little.

    You thought about congratulating them, but you haven't spoken to either of them in years.
    Best case scenario, they would invite you to some celebratory event you couldn't afford to attend.

    Besides, you've already called in enough days at work that requesting any more would probably get you fired.
    So instead you drank and kept scrolling, eyes half glazed over.

    Eventually you can't keep your eyes open at all anymore. You lean your head back against your couch
    and fall asleep, wishing you could be anyone and anywhere else.
