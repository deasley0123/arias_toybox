#Narration
It was a rainy Tuesday night. 

You came home from work to your small studio apartment, changed into sweatpants, grabbed a drink from the fridge and sat on the floor in front of your TV because it was more comfortable than your shitty IKEA couch.

You flipped through channels and eventually settled on a network game show you remembered watching with your grandmother when you were little.

It's more commercials than content now, and you quickly got bored and started scrolling on your phone. 

A friend of yours from high school posted some engagement photos. Another made a pregnancy announcement. 

You thought about congratulating them, but you haven't spoken to either of them in years. Best case scenario, they would invite you to some celebratory event you couldn't afford to attend. 

Besides, you've already called in enough days at work that requesting any more would probably get you fired. So instead you drank and kept scrolling, eyes half glazed over. 

Eventually you can't keep your eyes open at all anymore. You lean your head back against your shitty IKEA couch and fall asleep, wishing you could be anyone and anywhere else.

When you open your eyes again, you are no longer in your apartment.
#???
Hello? Helloooo? Is anyone in there?
#???
Blink twice if you can hear me! They're not blinking. THEY'RE NOT BLINKI-
Wait, you don't have eyelids.
#???
Uhhh... How about nodding? Maybe with a little help...
#Narration
A small hand reaches out to touch your head. It's warm.
#???
Oh! You're moving. That's a great sign!
#Narration
Above you is an unfamiliar ceiling. Pitched wooden beams over a small attic.
#Narration
Morning light streams golden through the window. The morning birdsong is foreign but beautiful.
#Narration
The walls are strewn with drawings, the uneven floor littered with books and candles. 
#Narration
There is a small, unmade bed in the corner, a disheveled arrangement of sheets and leather tomes.  
#Narration
The owner of which (you assume) peers over her hat at you, uncomfortably close now.
#Narration
You shift away, and she skitters back.
#???
Hey! You moved! That's great!! It worked!! I'm AMAZING!!!
#Serena
Where am I? Who are you? What's going on? Why-
#Narration
You are becoming aware of your body in spurts. Currently seated, your hands support you. 
The ground feels tacky to touch, prompting you to really see it... and your hands.
#Serena
Why is the ground covered in blood? WHY ARE MY HANDS PAWS?!?
#Aria
I'm Aria! You're my favorite doll: Jophiel the Duskborn, catfolk master thief, right hand of the Weald Queen! Unmatched in the fields of battle AND wits-
#Serena
My name is Serena.
I'm an Uber driver from Cleveland.
#Serena
What on Earth are you talking about?
#Aria
Ah! That's just the thing! You're not on Earth anymore at all!
#Aria
 I've summoned you here, Jophiel, to help me perform a mighty deed.
We're going on A QUEST!
#Aria
AREN'T YOU EXCITED?!
#Narration
The young girl beams at you. The blood-drawn ritual circle under you is starting to dry on the raw wood planks.
#Narration
You make one last futile attempt at normalcy.
#Serena
Is this... is this some kind of TikTok trend? Is someone filming me right now? It isn't funny.
#Aria
What's a TikTok? Like a clock?? I don't have a clock, silly!
#Aria
I'm not allowed around time anymore.
#Serena
...
#Aria
...
#Serena
...
#Narration
You change the subject.
#Serena
That hat... are you some kind of witch? Assuming any of this is real at all and it's not just a really weird dream.
#Narration
You had a slice of mushroom and black olive pizza last night, but they were just button mushrooms... right?
#Aria
Ahem. I am a Sorceress, not a Witch! The hat is for style.
#Narration
She poses, obviously trying to appear cool. 
You brush some dust off your knee and stand.
#Narration
You're a little taller than you were before, probably. There isn't anything familiar to measure against in here.
#Serena
Great, so you're a sorceress, and I'm a... toy? A five-foot talking cat?
#Narration
You feel the pointed ears in your hair and the weight of a long, thin tail stretching out behind you.
#Aria
Well, Jophiel-
#Serena
It's Serena.
#Aria
Hmmmm... That doesn't sound like much of a quest name. Serenas don't really go to do great deeds.
#Narration
You almost interject about the accomplishments of the famous people on Earth who share your name, but it's not like you've ever really done anything, personally, so you bite your tongue.
#Aria
Besides! Didn't you want to be someone else?
#Narration
Her question is genuine in a way children's questions often are, but your pulse quickens all the same.
#Serena
What do you mean? ...How did you know that?
#Aria
Oh. Well, it's a condition for my spell. I can only summon willing souls. It only works if you don't want to be who or where you are.
#Aria
I wouldn't want to pull you here if you were happier where you were.
#Aria
Soul magic like that makes me feel icky.
#Narration
This line of conversation is making you think about yourself more critically than is comfortable.
You change the subject again.
#Serena
What about my body here, then? Shouldn't I be soft, small, and full of cotton stuffing or something?
#Aria
Nope! I tried this spell before with lower quality stuff, but... it didn't work out.
#Aria
I HAD a rocking horse.
#Aria
Maple Stirrup, you will be remembered.
#Aria
I didn't really expect it to work with YOU either, but it's probably because Mom made Jophiel for me.
#Aria
She's a much more powerful Sorceress than me, so you must be made of quality stuff!
#Aria
As soon as your soul took root, you became big like that!
#Serena
Wow. Okay. So many questions about that. A lot to unpack there.
#Narration
You sense an opportunity. If her mother is a powerful sorceress as well, maybe she could fix whatever is going on here and send you home?
#Serena
So, uh, your mom is around then? I think we might be in need of some parental supervision.
#Aria
No, Mom is away conducting her research. She's been away for a while. It's just me here while she's gone.
#Narration
Aria's smile falls away for the first time since you woke. Her clear discomfort around this question gives you pause, but you push ahead regardless.
#Serena
Oh, well, if she's been away for a while then that must be our quest? Let's go and find your mom!
#Aria
No, I'm forbidden from interfering with Mom's work.
#Serena
Oh. Then-
#Aria
Our quest is something of far greater, far NOBLER importance!
#Serena
Well, maybe-
#Aria
Within this forest lies a creature foul and perverse.
To battle it is to court danger.
To challenge it is foolhardiness personified.
#Aria
BUT IT MUST BE DONE! THE BOG BEAST MUST BE CAPTURED!
#Aria
AND IF IT IS NOT BY OUR HAND, THEN BY WHOSE!?
#Serena
Anyone's! Yours! But not mine! I don't even have hands!?
#Aria
But I'm not allowed in the forest without supervision.
And Mom is never around to supervise me.
#Aria
But you're an adult. You could supervise me...
#Narration
This conversation is going nowhere. Or, at least, nowhere you want to go.
#Serena
Aria, please. I understand you're bored, and maybe a little lonely, but I can't stay here, okay?
#Serena
I need to go home.
#Aria
...
#Aria
I understand.
#Serena
Okay, good-
#Aria
If that's what you really want, I will send you home.
#Aria
I promise.
#Aria
...
#Aria
But I can only open a gate between worlds when the borders are thinnest.
#Narration
You feel a sinking weight in your stomach.
#Serena
When's that?
#Aria
Dawn and Dusk.
#Aria
I can't send you home until tonight.
#Narration
The weight in your stomach grows.
#Aria
So, since I can't send you back yet anyways...
And I still need adult supervision...
#Narration
You swallow hard and sigh. Her big eyes look up at you full of hope. 
When was the last time you looked at anything like that?
#Serena
Well, I've never been on any quests before. Certainly haven't encountered any bog beasts, so I don't know how much help I'll be.
#Narration
Even as you're speaking, you recognize that there isn't really a choice here. 
#Narration
You can whine and drag your feet, but the little girl in front of you is powerful enough to summon you from another world, apparently.
#Narration
If she wants to go on a quest, you're going on a quest. You can't even get her to call you by your actual name.
#Serena
But first, before any questing, my name-
#Aria
Jophiel.
#Serena
Serena.
#Aria
Jophiel.
#Serena
...
#Serena
Jo.
#Aria
...
#Jo
So, where is this bog beast anyhow?
#Aria
The bog beast slumbers in the murk at the heart of this very forest.
#Jo
So...
Maybe 20 minutes?
#Aria
More like an hour. I've got little legs.
#Jo
Better get moving then.
#Narration
With glee, she rushes to the window, throws it open, and lets down her sheets. You realize now that they've already been tied nicely for such a purpose.
#Aria
Down we go!
#Jo
We're not gonna use the door?
#Aria
Mom will know if we go that way! Besides, going out the window is how you always start an adventure!
#Narration
She throws you one last smile before sliding over the sill and down out of sight. 
#Narration
You sigh once more as you toss your own leg over and look down. The house is only one floor, plus this attic, so it isn't far to go. 
#Narration
Aria waits impatiently on the ground below.
#Aria
What are you waiting for? Our quest awaits!
