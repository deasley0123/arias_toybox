#Narration
The Beard & Brew is mostly empty when you and Aria make your way inside.
#Narration
It sits on the forest-side edge of a small, but respectable village. Thatch, Wood, and plaster homes and businesses dot a mercantile square. Just beyond lies cleared land littered with ripe green and gold crops, swaying in the breeze.
#Narration
A simple, but wide and well-maintained dirt road snakes through the buildings. It comes from over distant hills and continues off into a different part of the forest. One you haven't spent the better part of your day traipsing through.
#Narration
You passed a broad sign calling the settlement Woldthwaite. It's a mouthful and you doubt you'll remember it.
#Jo
It's a nice day around supper time. I wonder why it is so empty in here...?
#Narration
You don't quite realize you've said your thought aloud until the bartender responds.
#Tavernkeeper
Oy, welcome back! 'Tis a beautiful day out!
#Tavernkeeper
Most of the folks in town are gathering in the square. Talkin' about what to do regardin' the business in the Weald.
#Tavernkeeper
And there's hardly a visitor passin' through this year, exceptin' yourself I suppose!
#Tavernkeeper
Truth be told, I didn't expect to see you back so soon, if at all, given the trouble lately.
#Narration
You peer down at Aria who is staring open-mouthed at the Minotaur behind bar and his sparkling shelves of bottles.
#Jo
I thought you said you'd never been in town before, Aria?
#Aria
I haven't.
#Aria
This is my first time this far from home since I moved here with mom.
#Jo
Uhh... sorry, mister. This is our first time in. It's a lovely place you have here, though.
#Tavernkeeper
Thank ye! And my gravest apologies, 'tis rare to see a cat-folk in these parts.
#Tavernkeeper
And you're the spittin' image of one who passed through less than a dozen moons ago.
#Tavernkeeper
The Marquis had hired them to map the Kaistr Weald. Something about a land survey and resource bookkeeping.
#Tavernkeeper
Not the domain of an old keg-head like me!
#Narration
You don't quite know what to make of any of that, but before you can form a question Aria steps forward.
#Aria
Hail and well-met, oh tavern-keeper!
#Aria
I am Aria of the deep Weald, and this is {shader=jitter:3.0,3.0}{i}Jophiel, the Duskbo-{/i}{/shader}
#Jo
Hi, I'm Jo. This is Aria. We live off in the forest North of here. 
#Jo
Just came into town for a drink and meal after a loooong day.
#Aria
Upon the conclusion of our {i}GRAND QUEST{/i}, our bellies did rumble and our throats did thirst.
#Aria
{shader=jitter:3.0,3.0}WE MUST CELEBRATE WITH A FEAST! AND TANKARDS OF YOUR FINEST MEAD!{/shader}
#Jo
Please ignore that. She's very excited and also very much shouldn't be given alcohol.
#Jo
We would love a plate or bowl of whatever you have hot, and a couple glasses of...
#Aria
Beer!
#Jo
...Milk?
#Jo
Not, uh, because I'm a cat. Er, cat-folk.
#Jo
I just saw some cows in those fields, and she's a growing girl.
#Jo
And I think she mostly just drinks water made from magic which can't be great for you.
#Narration
The Minotaur nods and gives you a wink with a wry chuckle.
#Tavernkeeper
Not a problem, I keep some in the storehouse out back. Give me just a moment.
#Narration
He disappears from view and your stomach grumbles.
#Narration
You pat your hip where normally your wallet would be.
#Jo
Uhh... Aria?
#Jo
Do you, perhaps, have any money?
#Aria
Fear not, Jophiel!
#Aria
I prepared for this.
#Narration
She pulls out a large lumpy black stone and sets it on the counter.
#Narration
Her eyes flash and the room briefly fills with light. You recoil, but when your eyes stop watering you see a beautiful gem sitting where the rock was.
#Aria
Ta-da! Transmutation!
#Narration
Your brain races to consider how this child could disrupt whole economies.
#Jo
Uhh, wow. That looks great, Aria, but it might be a bit much.
#Aria
Oh, Jophiel, this is merely their cut of the spoils for sponsoring our expedition!
#Narration
She pats her stomach.
#Aria
You don't think they deserve any less, do you?
#Jo
Ah, no. I suppose when you put it that way...
#Narration
A meal isn't exactly a sponsorship, and this hastily made gem isn't exactly a spoil of your quest, but you are too hungry to argue.
#Narration
The tavern's keeper returns with two mugs and fills a couple bowls with a heavenly smelling soup from a warm pot behind the counter.
#Tavernkeeper
Here you are, dig in!
#Narration
SOME TIME PASSES
#Narration
The soup was hearty and filling, and the milk was a bit lukewarm but satisfied a deep craving you were unsure you'd want to admit to.
#Aria
Wow, I'm stuffed.
#Jo
Yeah, that really hit the spot, huh? 
#Aria
Definitely! That was my first soup! 
#Jo
Really? Being a wit- er, sorceress and all, I kind of expected you to have a big cauldron at home.
#Jo
Figured your mom was the soup type.
#Aria
No. Mom used to bring me berries and mushrooms from the forest, but I'm /"old enough to make my own food/" now.
#Aria
She only really eats with magic, too, so I've never had a meal like this before.
#Aria
It was soooooo goood!!
#Aria
Tomorrow, we should come back!
#Aria
Or, maybe, we forage and make some soup!
#Aria
Find a /"cauldron/" of our own!
#Jo
Soup is actually one of the only things I know how to make.
#Jo
I'm no pro in the kitchen, but I took a food prep class in community college.
#Jo
We could try-
#Narration
You trail off, feeling like you're forgetting something as you notice the lengthening shadows cast by the window.
#Narration
The sun is still up, but dusk isn't long, now.
#Narration
In all the excitement of the day, you'd almost forgotten your deal. The time to go back home is almost here.
#Jo
We should try heading back to your house. It'll be dusk here in an hour or so.
#Aria
Oh.
#Aria
Right.
#Aria
I'm sorry, I forgot about our promise.
#Aria
...
#Aria
...
#Aria
I guess I won't get to try your soup?
#Narration
She looks at you, and she hesitates.
#Aria
Unless...
#Aria
Unless, maybe, you stayed?
#Aria
For just a few more days?
#Aria
I could send you home at any dawn or dusk, it doesn't have to be tonight.
%options_3
You could stay.
You need to go.
%choice_3_1
#Narration
What is your life back home, really?
#Narration
You live on your own in the small flat your grandmother left you in her will.
#Narration
Your cheap car is paid off. Your job is just gig work. There's hardly anything in the fridge to spoil.
#Narration
You have nothing pressing, not even a house plant to water.
#Narration
Without realizing it, you'd already molded your life into a shape you could leave at any time.
#Narration
A break from your rut, maybe even a long one, could be for the best.
#Narration
Today hasn't been a relaxing one.
#Narration
You woke up in a strange place with a strange body and a strange child. Most of the day has been exhausting hiking through dense woods.
#Narration
But it all feels a little less strange now, and you feel... satisfied? Maybe happier, too, than you have in ages.
#Jo
You know, I'm not sure I'm in such a rush anymore.
#Jo
I could stay for a while.
#Aria
{shader=jitter:3.0,3.0}REALLY?!{/shader}
#Jo
Yeah, really.
#Jo
We should probably make our way back before dark, though.
%choice_3_2
#Narration
You had expected this, to a degree. The thought had even crossed your mind about staying. 
#Narration
But this world, this body, it is all so unfamiliar to you. It isn't home.
#Narration
While you may be in a bit of a rut back on Earth, visiting here and spending time with Aria has reminded you that truly anything is possible.
#Narration
Running away here will not change your life for the better, you have to go back and make those changes for yourself.
#Narration
And maybe you'll fail again, or it won't work out like you hoped. But it will be your life to live, not one that anyone else would make for you.
#Narration
Resolved, you see the longing in her eyes, and you know what you say next will break her heart a little.
#Narration
You also know that life comes with heartbreak as part of the package. You do your best to soften the blow.
#Jo
Aria, I've really enjoyed today. Together we subdued the mighty Bog Beast!
#Jo
I was in a rough spot when you pulled me here, but just like [bogbeast], I have a place I have to return to.
#Jo
Will you take me home?
#Aria
Yeah. I can do that.
%resume_3_1
#Narration
Before you can stand up to pay or leave, the buckle on Aria's hat begins to glow.
#Aria
Oh, oh, OH! Oh, no.
#Aria
Mom's home.
#Narration
The buckle glows brighter, and with a flash Aria is gone.
#Jo
Uh, Aria? {shader=jitter:3.0,3.0}Aria!{/shader}
#Tavernkeeper
What in the gods was that? Teleportation?
#Jo
Uhhh, I'm really not sure. Maybe?
#Jo
She is a sorceress. Said her mom was too. Mom lives out in the forest doing some kind of research in the area?
#Tavernkeeper
Out in the Weald? Didn't figure anyone lived out there. There's nothing but trees between here and Rimmond.
#Tavernkeeper
The woods have always been dangerous, but the last few years have been fraught with disappearances and strange sightings.
#Jo
Yeah, some Green-Eyed Demon, right?
#Jo
We met a short guy and a... tree-person? They mentioned something like that.
#Tavernkeeper
Aye. They sent me a message by bluebird earlier.
#Tavernkeeper
Said they had found a clear set of signs, a trail deeper into the Weald.
#Tavernkeeper
Never did hear more.
#Tavernkeeper
That's the business the town is discussing in the square.
#Tavernkeeper
Talk is, a posse of seasoned hunters and retired knights from the farmholds around here were going to head out before dark.
#Tavernkeeper
I intend to close up here and go with them. If that girl and her mother are out there, they may know a thing or two... or be in danger themselves.
#Tavernkeeper
Sounds like you have an idea of where they're living. Care to join our posse tonight?
%options_4
There is safety in numbers.
You'd rather go alone.
#If_Block
go_home==true
#Narration
Your only ticket home is with Aria or her mom. Whatever the danger, you've got to make it back there tonight.
#If_Block
go_home==false
#Narration
Aria disappearing wasn't a wrinkle you expected when you said you'd stay.
#Narration
But if Aria's mom is back and you're going to stick around, it would be good to clear everything with her anyways.
%choice_4_1
#Jo
Yeah, I'd feel better with some company. And I think I could find my way back to her place.
#Narration
It's true. Perhaps because she summoned you here, you feel a gentle pull to the forest. Towards Aria.
%choice_4_2
#Jo
Sorry, I've had a long day and a lot to think about. I'll get there faster on my own.
#Narration
The Minotaur eyes you with concern but lets you leave without accosting you further.
#Narration
Perhaps because she summoned you here, you feel a gentle pull in your chest towards the forest. Towards Aria.
%resume_4
#Narration
You sigh, and bury your concern for Aria for now. She's a powerful sorceress, as is her mother.
#Narration
Everything is fine, right?
#Narration
There is a void left by Aria's absence. When she's around, you're pulled along, break-neck by her current.
#Narration
Her exuberant presence gone, everything slows, and the conversations of the day begin to swirl in your mind.
#Narration
Unease sets in as the sun drops lower on the horizon.
#Jo
Once more, into the Weald.
