#Narration
You almost jump out of your skin when you feel something touch your arm.
#Narration
Aria hisses a whisper at you.
#Aria
SERENA!! Mom's gonna be really mad if she finds us down here!
#Narration
Whatever game you were playing before, even Aria has dropped it in this place.
#Aria
I'm {i}suuuper{/i} not allowed in mom's workshop. I've never been down here before. She'll know we came in.
#Narration
Aria is preoccupied, glancing back at the stairs. Too worried about you and now her mom, she hasn't taken a good look around yet.
#Serena
Aria, this is very bad. Where is your mom?
#Serena
Where is your mom right now?
#Aria
She was already really, really, {i}really{/i} mad when I wasn't here. I didn't think she'd be leaving me alone again any time soon.
#Aria
But then she said something about /'pests in the forest/' and told me to stay here and wait until she came back.
#Narration
You know that your time is limited. This room, the stories you heard, the town's fears.
#Narration
You feel certain that if you're still here when Aria's mother returns, you will not survive.
#Narration
If the mob arrives instead, you're pretty sure the result will be the same.
#Serena
Aria, I don't want to scare you, and I don't say this as a game or to hurt you. 
#Serena
Your mom made that damage in the forest. The one who's been taking people? It's her.
#Narration
You take a deep, shuddering breath. And then you drop the pit from your stomach into hers.
#Serena
And I'm pretty sure that if I'm still here when she gets back... she'll kill me.
#Narration
Aria stares at you and stammers weakly in protest.
#Aria
No- no, you've... You've been so nice to me, and you even said you'd stay! She wouldn't! She wouldn't...
#Serena
Aria, do you remember the adventurers we met in the woods?
#Narration
She nods. You direct her eyes up to the shelf in front of you.
#Serena
She... she's done something to them. Something very, very bad.
#Serena
I think I, this body, your... toy. I think I was someone else before. Someone who met the same fate as them and I don't know how many others.
#Serena
And when she comes back...
#Narration
You swallow hard.
#Serena
That'll be me. Again.
#Narration
She stares at the doll-sized people for what feels like an eternity. Her own panicked tears begin to well in her green eyes.
#Serena
I know, I know it is a lot to process. But, Aria, I have to go-
#Narration
She looks at you now. Her lip trembles.
#Narration
You take a deep breath, trying desperately to steady yourself.
#Serena
And I think you should come with me. 
#Narration
You want to live, but you aren't prepared to sacrifice her to whatever life she might face here.
#Narration
This is also a lot of information all at once, most of it life-changing. You can see her mind spinning.

#Narration
You crouch down to her level, and you take her hands in yours. 
#Jophiel
{i}You{/i} are my Weald Queen, Aria. And I, Jophiel, am your right hand.
#Jophiel
Enemies approach us now from several fronts. As your trusted guardian, your safety is paramount to me.
#Jophiel
But I am still new to this realm, and I require your might and cunning.
#Serena
Please, Aria.
I can't get us to safety alone.
#Narration
She considers you silently at first.
#Narration
The immediate dangers aside, the revelations you've brought seem to have shaken her, but not to her foundations.
#Narration
You suspect some part of her knew already. Her imagined worlds and daring escapades a welcome distraction from her harsh reality.
#Aria
We...
#Aria
We probably can't just run away through the Weald.
#Jophiel
Right, you've got little legs.
#Aria
And Mom knows the forest reaaally well.
#Narration
Thinking about your options, she tugs on her hat nervously.
#Narration
But then she looks up, with a wide smile.
#Aria
Right! My hat! The buckle!
#Aria
I'm not as skilled as Mom, but I could probably reverse the enchantment on it.
#Jophiel
What would that do?
#Aria
Rather than bring me to her, it could send us away! Only...
#Jophiel
Only?
#Aria
I can't control where it goes. It might be really far from here.
#Narration
You're silent, thinking about her suggestion when you hear the door upstairs creak open.
#Narration
The way Aria freezes, you don't have to ask who it is.
#Narration
You take hold of her hands again.

Bond == full
#Jophiel
It's okay, Aria. I'm here with you, and wherever we end up, I won't leave you alone.
#Narration
She nods and grips your hands tighter.
#Narration
She closes her eyes and pulls you close. Her buckle begins to glow with a deep purple hue.
#Narration
In an instant, the two of you are somewhere else. It isn't easy to start over when you don't know where you are or where you're going. But the two of you are together.
#Narration
Whether it be school, work, your relationships or your goals, you half-assed everything in your life before. But you throw yourself into this with determination you didn't know you had in you.
#Narration
You try to find opportunities to make Aria smile every day. It isn't easy taking care of someone else, but you can't imagine anything more worth doing.
#Narration
It's you and her in a new world. She summoned you because she needed you, and until she no longer needs you, you'll be by her side.
#If_block
Bond != full
#Serena
We need to go.
#Narration
Aria hesitates one last time.
#Narration
Then she throws her arms around you... and her hat on your head.
#Aria
Goodbye, Serena.
#Narration
In an instant, you are somewhere else.
#Narration
It isn't easy to start over when you don't know where you are, but you throw yourself into it. You have a destination, and you won't get there without all your effort.
#Narration
You know you came from the Kaistr Weald. There is a nearby capital city, Rimmond. You even remember the town's name, Woldthwaite. 
#Narration
You ask a lot of questions, more than most people can even answer, but slowly you understand the basics of this foreign world.
#Narration
Once you have your bearings and save enough to buy a map, you return there. To the Weald. To Aria's cottage.
#Narration
The cottage is empty. The basement cleared out, and the attic, too. You don't know where Aria and her mother went, and the trail here goes cold.
#Narration
Without Aria, you are as unmoored in this world as you were in Cleveland. But you aren't stuck anymore, and you've proven resilient carving out a living here.
#Narration
You wanted to stay here as a second chance at living. You'll have to figure out what that means for yourself.
