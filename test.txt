#Narration
The front door to the small cottage has no lock. You suppose there's no need, or rather, the illusion you passed through {i}was{/i} the lock.
#Narration
You quietly clear your throat as you swing the door open, intending to call out.
#Narration
But the air within the cottage is silent, still, and any sound you were going to make dies in your throat. 
#Narration
It feels wrong to break this silence. Dangerous, somehow.
#Narration
To your right is a small room with a hearth, fire barely smoldering, herbs drying on the mantle. A table and one chair are the room's only occupants. A curtain keeps most of the room in shadow from the fading sunlight.
#Narration
In front of you is a staircase leading to Aria's room in the attic.
#Narration
To your left is a narrow door just barely cracked open, a soft glow bleeding along the door's edge.

#Narration
You're fairly certain that you'll find Aria in the attic. 
#If_Block
goHome == True
#Narration
Not only is it her room, but it's where the summoning circle is, and she did promise to send you home.
#If_Block
Resume
#Narration
Your ears swivel and your whiskers twitch, on keen alert as you ascend the stairs.
#Narration
The floorboards above you creak lightly, and you freeze.
#Narration
You can almost peer over the lip of the floorboards, so you take one more step up. 
#Narration
The moment you do, two little hands wrench you up the rest of the stairs with surprising strength.
#Aria
Jophiel!
#Narration
She hugs you quickly, then lets go of everything but your hand. 
#Aria
I'm so glad you made it back safe!
#Aria
When Mom summons me like that, there's nothing I can do. I'm sorry.
#Jo
Hey, it's okay. Are you alright?
#Narration
She nods quickly. Too quickly, as if she's trying to dismiss the question.

#Narration
Your heart only recently settled from fleeing the mob in the woods begins race again as you approach the door.
#If_Block
goHome == True
#Narration
Aria promised to take you home, and you know your ticket back is the ritual circle upstairs, but...
#If_Block
resume
#Narration
You need more answers than you have, and you know Aria can only tell you so much.
#Narration
You gently pull open the door. A series of cold, stone stairs lead you down into the earth.
#Narration
Every tuft of fur on your body stands, a warning. You push your fear aside and continue.
#Narration
An acrid, foreign stench immediately assaults your nostrils. Followed by a smell you only know from visiting your grandmother in her final days.
#Narration
It's the smell of death.
#Narration
To one side is an empty caldron, a ritual circle, and a table of magical implements, tinctures, and tools.
#Narration
To the other, bits of body and flesh, jars of pieces and parts, and dolls. Shrunken forms.
#Narration
You step into the room, clutching at your mouth and nose. Your eyes are glued to the back. A shelf.
#Narration
Two figures you unfortunately recognize the likeness of. A tree-person and a gnomish sort.
#Narration
The bile you've been holding back stings your throat as tears of fear and frustration gather in the creases of your eyes.
