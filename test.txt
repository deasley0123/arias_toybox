#Narration
Reeds, bullrush, sunlit murky pond. Lilly pads, crickets and frogsong. Canopy of trees closing over the ponds like a cathedral. Note: Been a lot of breeze, but the air is still now.. waiting
#Narration
Aria is clambering across the ground on all fours, her face obscured by cattails.
#Narration
She gestures for you to crouch down next to her. You step gingerly to keep your feet from sinking in the muck.
#Narration
She whispers in your general direction as she peers through the reeds, but she doesn't turn her face.
#Aria
We're upon him now.
#Aria
I can smell him on the wind.
#Aria
I can hear his slumbering breaths.
#Narration
She gasps, a small delicate thing.
#Aria
Be still, he hasn't noticed us yet.
#Narration
You peer over her shoulder, trying to see what she sees. You whisper back.
#Jo
What am I looking for?
#Narration
Your mind spins with images of prehistoric behemoths, of shambling masses of vine and thorn, of every cryptid ever caught on blurry film.
#Narration
Glimpses of half-submerged reeds morph into sharpened dorsal spines. Moss riddled logs conceal bristling fur, crouching beasts coiled to pounce.
#Aria
{i}His stench is his first line of defense.{/i}
#Aria
{i}The scent has felled many a party before they ever reached him.{/i}
#Aria
{i}Stomaching that, his next danger is his thundering, guttural call.{/i}
#Aria
{i}It echoes in your mind, driving you to {shader=jitter:1.0,1.0}madness.{/shader}{/i}
#Aria
{i}All of that is but harbinger of what he is capable of.{/i}
#Aria
{i}His true talent lies in his camouflage. His bark-like skin itself is perfectly suited to ambush.{/i}
#Aria
{i}He watches the world with patient, cunning eyes.{/i}
#Aria
{i}No one who dares observe him lives to tell the tale.{/i}
#Aria
{i}And yet, {shader=jitter:2.0,2.0}I see him now!{/shader}{/i}
#Narration
Your fur stands on end, and you feel a hiss building in the back of your throat.
#Narration
Your eyes dilate to the extreme, taking in every swishing reed, every rocking lily pad.
#Jo
Where is he? In the water? In the trees?
#Aria
{i}He reclines, perched upon his verdant throne.{/i}
#Aria
{i}His mighty thighs and the crown of his brow are adorned with horns.{/i}
#Aria
{i}Every muscle ripples, tensed for war!{/i}
#Narration
A large toad on a lily pad catches a passing bug, tongue flashing briefly.
#Narration
Aria dives into the reeds.
#Aria
{shader=jitter:3.0,3.0}HE'S SEEN US! Now, Jophiel!!{/shader}
#Jo
Now what!? All I see is some toad! (with vpunch)
