#Jo
So, what are you going to name him?
#Narration
You and Aria left the secluded pond, returning to something like a path through the forest. Or the weald, as the young girl calls it.
#Narration
The sun is directly above you now, sending even brighter orange-tinted light through the trees.
#Narration
In the orange light, Aria holds up the "bog beast," examining him with a tilt of her head.
#Aria
Hmm... Well, a formidable warrior such as this one deserves an equally fearsome name. 
#Narration
The large angry-looking toad croaks at her, but makes no attempt to so much as wriggle out of her grasp.
#Aria
I know!
#Narration
She stops walking, and spins around to you so suddenly that you nearly run into her. 
#Aria
Jophiel! Since you helped so much in our quest, you deserve the honor of naming our new companion! 
#PROMPT
Name the Bog Beast: _______
#Jo
How about _______?
#Aria
I love it!
#Narration
As if catching herself, Aria blinks, then clears her throat. She brings the toad close, looking him in the eye, snout to snout. 
#Aria
Oh mighty Bog Beast, stalwart guardian of the Weald Queen's domain...
#Aria
Thy name is...
#Aria
{shader=jitter:3.0,3.0}_______!!!{/shader}
#Bog_Beast
*Ribbit*
#Aria
He loves it too! 
#Aria
Excellent choice, Jophiel.
#Jo
Happy to help.
#Narration
You resume walking together. Aria holds _______ in her hands for a while before the toad begins to struggle.
#Aria
What's wrong, _______? Do you need to use the little bog beast's room?
#Narration
She grips him a little tighter. The toad gives a slightly angrier croak.
%choice_1_1
#Narration
You remember reading a book about parenting, back when you thought you might have kids one day.
#Narration
It said, {i}Children have to learn to be kind to others.{/i}
%choice_1_2
#Narration
You remember her story about the tuna, the undead fish swimming around in a pit until it began to stink.
#Narration
{i}Mom didn't see much of a difference either way,{/i} Aria had said. 
%resume_2
#Jo
Hey, if he wants you to let him go, you have to let him go. 
#Aria
B... But I don't want him to run away! 
#Narration
You nod seriously, and bite your lip to keep from smiling. You feel for this kid. It took you until your last breakup to finally learn this lesson yourself.
#Narration
You kneel down next to her so that you can look her face to face. You gently place your hands over hers. 
#Jo
You can't make anyone stay in your life unless they want to, Aria. 
#Narration
Just as gently, you guide her hands to the ground.
#Jo
If you give them the choice to stay, and they decide to leave, that's sad, but it's okay. It isn't your fault.
#Narration
You pause. The toad wriggles, but she isn't holding him so tightly that she'll hurt him.
#Narration
She seems to be considering your words. 
#Jo
Now if they want to leave, and you don't let them... well, you know how it feels when you're forced to do something you don't want to do, right?
#Aria
Yeah.
#Narration
She squeezes just a little tighter, for a moment. 
#Narration
Then she sets the toad on the ground.
#Bog_Beast
*Ribbit*
#Narration
The toad looks around himself, then hops into a nearby fern.
#Narration
Aria sighs, and sniffles.
#Jo
I bet he can still hear you. Do you want to tell him anything before he goes? 
#Aria
Bye, ________. I really wanted you to be my familiar.
#Aria
...
#Aria
But if you want to keep guarding your lair, I guess that's okay too. 
#Jo
He is the Weald Queen's stalwart guardian, after all.
#Aria
Yeah. He probably has lots of responsibilities.
#Jo
Definitely.
#Narration
All at once, the young girl hugs you. The surprise of it nearly knocks you over.
%options_2
Return her hug.
Wait until she lets go.
%choice_2_1
#Narration
You're soft at first, worried a stray claw might dig into her if you aren't careful.
#Narration
But, after a moment, you hold her as tightly as she holds you.
#Narration
She's so small.
#Narration
Her heart beats so fast. Her arms feel so fragile around your neck.
#Narration
Eventually she releases you, and you let her go.
%choice_2_2
#Narration
The hug shouldn't surprise you so much. You're her favorite doll, after all. Who else would she go to for comfort?
#Narration
Even so, you can't bring yourself to hug her back.You just let her hold you until she's ready to let go.
#Narration
Gradually, she does.
%resume_2
#Jo
You did good. That's a tough thing to do, but it's important.   
#Narration
She sniffles.
#Aria
I'm going to be alone again.
#Jo
Only for a little while. Just until your mom comes back. Right?
#Narration
She's quiet for a long time.
#Narration
She's quiet for long enough that you start to wonder if that was the wrong thing to say, somehow. 
#Narration
That's all this was, wasn't it?
#Narration
Keeping a bored, magical little girl entertained? Keeping her company while Mom is away?
#Narration
You didn't sign up for any of this. You only barely signed up to take her on this quest. And only because you had no other choice. 
#Narration
She brought you into this world, and she's your only way back. 
#Narration
You stand up, and dust a fallen leaf off your shoulder.
#Jo
Well... 
#Jo
You're not alone right now. I'm here with you. And it isn't sundown yet. 
#Jo
So, where to next?
#Narration
She watches you for a moment. Then she pulls her magic mirror out of her bag.  
#Aria
Our quest completed, we can now feast in the Halls of Gods and Kings! 
#Narration
She shows you, in a misty image in the mirror, a small tavern. 
#Aria
There's a town not too far from here.
#Narration
A man passes by in the mirror, carrying a large glass of amber liquid and a steaming plate of something like pot roast.
#Narration
Your stomach rumbles.
#Jo
Food is good. How far? Twenty minutes?
#Aria
Mmmm... 
#Jo
Right. Got it. Little legs. 
#Aria
This way!
#Narration
She rushes off. You follow. 
#Narration
You walk all of three minutes before stopping again.
#Narration
You notice it first, your whiskers twitching in the suddenly silent forest. You reach out to stop Aria, but she sees it now too.
#Narration
Like a gash ripped through skin, the trees and underbrush in front of you are slashed and torn apart. Tree trunks lay with clumps of dirt caught in their newly unearthed roots, the leaves on the branches still green where they haven't been shaken off completely.
#Narration
One of the upturned trees has claw marks like the ones Toorg and Gerald pointed out. 
#Narration
Aria's voice is even softer than it was by the pond.
#Aria
What do you think did that?
#Jo
No idea. Let's try not to find out.
#Aria
But-
#Narration
You put a hand to her back and turn her away from the arboreal massacre.
#Jo
One adventure per meal. Feast first, then we'll see about this. Only fair, right?
#Aria
Okay...
#Narration
She sighs, but her stomach rumbles pitifully.
#Narration
You glance back as you walk away. You hope you distracted her before she noticed the bag hanging in the branches of the clawed tree.
#Narration
The bag that you're certain Gerald was wearing earlier.
