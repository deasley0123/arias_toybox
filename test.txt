#Aria
I'm fine. But we have to hurry, we're running out of time to send you back!
#Narration
She's right. The sun is hastening it's descent. Darkness will be here soon.
#Aria
I have everything set up, already.
#Narration
She settles you down in the now-familiar circle. You take what will probably be your last look around this attic.
#Narration
You're oddly nostalgic for the space.
#Aria
Ahem.
#Aria
Are you ready to go?

#Narration
Some part of you wants to pepper Aria with questions, follow up on the concerns the mob from town raised on the way here.
#Narration
But you see how Aria is just barely holding together, resolved to honor her promise.
#Narration
You won't sully her effort, and you trust her. Whatever the truth may be.
#If_block
notFullBond
#Narration
You think of the posse in the forest, the fears they shared, the trembling hands gripping their pitchforks.
#Jo
I didn't see your mom when I came in. Is she gone so soon after getting back?
#Aria
No, she was... mad. I don't think she's gonna leave me alone again for a bit.
#Narration
You would expect her to be more excited about her mom being around more, but mostly Aria looks troubled.
#Aria
She only left just now to /'take care of some pests in the woods/.'
#Narration
Your mind spins rational explanations. Perhaps she's already aware of it and going to go and aid the town with the Green-Eyed Demon.
#Narration
Or... perhaps... There is a next question to ask, but you can't quite bring it to your lips before you notice the sky growing truly dark.
#Narration
You may not have every answer, in fact you're not sure you want them, but you do know for certain that you can't spend any more time searching.
#Narration
You need to go home.

Resume
#Jo
The sun is getting low, I'm as ready as I can be.
#Narration
You were asleep for this the first time, so you're not quite sure what to expect. You feel something like a static charge in your fur as the ritual begins.
#Jo
Thank you, Aria.
#Jo
Not just for sending me back, but for bringing me here, too. I'm glad it was me you summoned.
#Narration
Her facade finally cracks a little.
#Aria
I'll miss you.
#Aria
I'm grateful it was you, too.
#Aria
I hope things get better for you in Cleveland.
#Jo
Me too. I think they will.
I may not meet the requirements for your spell anymore, but you're welcome to peer in on me in your mirror anytime.
#Jo
And /'Jophiel/' will still be here for you when I'm gone.

#Aria
I think I like Serena even better than Jophiel.
#Narration
You feel the magic swell beneath you. Your body grows light as your soul and conscious mind begin to separate.
#Narration
The last you see of this world is the tear stained smile of the young sorceress.
#Narration
When you woke up in your world again, it would have been easy enough to dismiss everything you experienced as nothing but a vivid dream. 
#Narration
Even if you did lose far more time than usual "sleeping." Even if your own body felt strangely foreign for a little while.
#Narration
Even if, around Halloween, the sight of a child in a witch hat made you choke up.
#Narration
You didn't dismiss it, though. It was real enough for you. And you were going to do what you told Aria you would: find ways to enjoy life again.
#Narration
After all, if she was going to look in on you from time to time, you wanted to make that an adventure.
#If_block
notFullBond
#Aria
Yeah.
#Narration
You feel the magic swell beneath you. Your body grows light as your soul and conscious mind begin to separate.
#Narration
While you were focused on Aria, even your sensitive ears missed the footsteps on the stairs.
#Narration
The last you see of this world is the tear stained face of the young sorceress, gazing up, anxious, at her returned mother.
#Narration
You don't know what happened to her next. 
#Narration
You returned to your world. If anyone noticed you were gone, they didn't show it.
#Narration
It would have been easy to dismiss everything that happened as a vivid dream. And you tried to. Even when you lost nearly a whole day "sleeping." Even when your own body felt strangely foreign to you afterward.  
#Narration
Even when, around Halloween, just the sight of a kid in a witch hat made your heart twist in your chest.
#Narration
You told yourself it was a dream. It had to be. Aria didn't exist except as some strange corner of your subconscious. 
#Narration
One that was urging you to live life a little more like it matters, maybe.
#Narration
Or maybe just to call your mom.
#Narration
What was the other option, after all? If it was all real, if she did exist in some other world... 
#Narration
Then that hand on her shoulder was also real. And so was the look of dread in her eyes when she looked up. 
#Narration
And also, just as real, was the fact that you left, and there's nothing you can do now.
#Narration
So you went back to your life. And you tried not to think about the strange dream, or the ways things might have changed if you had let them.
