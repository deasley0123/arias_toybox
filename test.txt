#Narration
The posse from the town is larger than you expected, but less professional than the barkeep made it sound.
#Narration
There are roughly two dozen able-bodied adults, mostly humans, which is somewhat surprising given Aria is the only human you'd interacted with today.
#Narration
But there is only one spear and two real swords to go around, with a collection of sharp farm tools and heavy mallets otherwise.
#Narration
Some also carry bows, but they look distinctly hand-made and somewhat crudely at that.
#Narration
This isn't a town of warriors. Apart from the barkeep, nobody else from the town even seems brave enough to talk to you, outsider and cat-person that you are.
#Narration
The barkeep does more than make up for what the posse lacks, though. Both in might for your expedition and in conversation. He makes idle chatter with you about the recent harvest (quite good) and the regional taxes (too high).
#Narration
When that topic is exhausted, he asks you about yourself, and your relationship to Aria. You lie hastily that you were hired to watch over her while her mom is away, although it was through an intermediary and you haven't actually met her mom, yet.
#Narration
To support your story, you describe what you can of your day. Adventuring in the woods, meeting Toorg and Gerald, catching a toad, and coming to town. You fill him in as well on the damage you saw in the woods, and Gerald's bag you saw there.
#Narration
He was quiet while you recounted your day, only nodding along and listening patiently to you prattle, but he speaks up now. He's abrupt with you for the first time today.
#Barkeep
Why didn't you mention that earlier, at my tavern?
#Jo
Sorry, I guess I should have. I just didn't want to scare the kid.
#Narration
At the mention of Aria and the tavern, you remember the gem she made.
#Jo
Oh, that's right! I also needed to give this to you. I forgot about it when she disappeared.
#Jo
We didn't have any money to pay you for the meal and milk, so she made you this gem.
#Narration
He accepts it from you with a deeply troubled look.
#Jo
Yeah, I'm not sure if that's enough or really counts as currency? I can ask her mom to reimburse you, maybe?
#Barkeep
This is... she made this? Out of what?
#Jo
Uh, like a rock. A normal rock as far as I could tell.
#Narration
He scrutinizes you like he's sizing you up. Your honesty, your capabilities, your intentions.
#Jo
I'm sorry I don't have better answers for you. I know basically nothing about magic.
#Barkeep
Well, I'm no mage myself, but I was a guard in the palace in Rimmond for many years before retiring here.
#Barkeep
No COURT mage could perform transmutation on this level so casually, never mind an apprentice of her age. That teleportation earlier too.
#Barkeep
This girl is... something else.
#Barkeep
I also kept something from you. There was more to the message I received from Gerald.
#Barkeep
He said the markings seemed strategic rather than instinctual. A warning for people, not beasts. There were faint traces of magic, too. 
#Barkeep
I've been retired to Woldthwaite damn near 10 years. No head, no tail, no hide nor hair of anyone living out here in the Weald like this.
#Narration
As he waits for your response, you realize this is where this conversation was always leading.
#Narration
Under the cover of polite concern, he had extracted exactly what he needed to determine you were not a threat, and that Aria and her mother might be.
#Barkeep
The child had green eyes, and I'd bet anything the mother does too.
#Narration
You start to immediately stammer out a defense for Aria but you stop yourself.
#Narration
You can't outright deny she's powerful, and you haven't even seen her mom. They may be right to be suspicious.
#Narration
But you note the way the others in the posse have been watching you and listening to this conversation unfold. You see how they grip their weapons.
#Narration
This posse is starting to feel more like a mob, and you're not sure which end of the pitchfork you'll end up on.
%options_5
Protect Aria.
Lead them to her.
%options_5_1
#Narration
Aria may be deeply magical, but she's just a lonely child.
#Narration
She only brought you here because you didn't want to be yourself. She took your lesson to heart and let [bogbeastname] go.
#If_Block
goHome == True
#Narration
Even though it will mean her search for companionship continues, she's promised to honor your deal and send you home. 
#If_Block
GoHome == False
#Narration
Although it has only been a day, she's become dear to you. You decided to stay here to care for her and find purpose for yourself.
#ResumeFromIf
Resume
#Narration
She doesn't deserve a mob at her door.
#Jo
Hey. Aria is just an innocent little kid. I spent the whole day with her.
#Jo
Her magic may be the real deal, but she would never hurt anyone.
#Jo
I think her mom might be kind of shit at being a mom, but I'm not going to bring a bunch of armed and angry assholes to her door on a hunch!
#Barkeep
I'm sorry, Jophiel, but that {i}hunch{/i} is what we have, and we're going to pursue it to the end.
#Narration
The air is still as the minotaur and the rest of the mob all watch you. A few of the members at the back start to shuffle around. Soon you'll be surrounded.
#Narration
You don't give them the chance. You turn and run without another thought.
#Narration
Despite their numbers advantage, you quickly lose them. It's simple, really.
#Narration
Your eyes are made for the fading light. Your feet are lighter than theirs, and your footfalls are near silent even in all the brush.
#Narration
Their rough voices calling for you to stop and wait have long faded away behind you when the trees grow too dense to traverse.
#Narration
You stop, but the tugging in your chest still directs you forwards.
#Narration
You scratch your head. You may not know this whole forest, but you {i}really{/i} don't remember this tight copse of trees here, so close to Aria's house.
#Narration
You are searching for a way around when you hear a familiar croak.
#BogBeast
*ribbit*
#Narration
[bogbeastname] sits nonplussed at the base of one of the larger trees.
#Narration
You take a step towards him, and when you do he jumps up and {i}through{/i} the solid tree as if it isn't there.
#Jo
Uh... [bogbeastname]?
#Narration
You reach out to the tree, and at first touch it feels real enough, but as you press on it the sensation of the bark surface starts to give way.
#Narration
Hesitantly, you push your way through the tree, or the illusion of one. Your fur stands on end as you do, and you feel a strange pressure in your head.
#Narration
It's similar to the pressure you'd feel right before your ears popped on a plane, only it's all through your skull, deep behind your eyes. It builds and builds.
#Narration
Until it too pops, and you're on the other side. You see Aria's cottage, a thin trail of smoke rising from the chimney, the illusion warding you away now behind you.
#Jo
Well, that explains why nobody has found the place.
#Jo
I guess I'll go in through the door this time.
%options_5_2
#Narration
Unbidden, the image of Aria holding the toad too tightly comes to your mind.
#If_Block
bond1 == True
#Narration
And you recall her story about reviving the dead tuna to play with.
#Narration
There is also, of course, the whole matter of kidnapping your soul and stuffing you in this body. 
#Narration
Aria has a great deal of power and very little in her life to make sure she uses it safely or responsibly.
#Narration
Her mother isn't even around most of the time, it seems, and what you've heard of her secondhand is not exactly comforting.
#Narration
There's all the neglect of her daughter, and Aria even said that her mom doesn't see a lot of difference between the living and the dead.
#Narration
There are a lot of red flags, and if she really is an incredible sorceress too... Well, the folks in town have a strong case to ask some more questions from the source.
#Jo
You're... you're right to be suspicious, I think.
#Jo
I have a lot of unanswered questions, too. I'll take us to her house.
#Jo
Hopefully we can get some answers.
#Jo
But I need you to promise me to do for them what you've done with me here. Ask questions first.
#Barkeep
Of course! This is a hunt for a demon, and we'll not take any hasty action until we know more.
#If_Block
goHome==False
bond1==True
bond2==True
#Narration
You choose to trust his words for now, but if anything starts going badly, you'll do everything you can to get Aria away to safety.
#Narration
You decided to stay here for her, and you won't allow her to be hurt, not while she's in your care.
#If_Block
goHome==False
#Narration
You choose to trust his words for now, but you start to wonder if your decision to say was such a good one after all.
#If_Block
goHome==True
#Narration
You choose to trust his words for now. Maybe while they're busy talking with mom, you could have Aria send you home?
#Narration
Following the tugging in your chest and your memories from the day, you lead the town towards the clearing where Aria's house is.
#Narration
But in your path stands a dense copse of unfamiliar trees. Too dense to really fit through, and stretching on for some distance to either side.
#Jo
Huh. That's weird. It should be right through here, but... I don't think these trees were here this morning.
#Barkeep
Could be druid-craft at work. I think we've brought along an axe or two.
#Narration
A few men step forward to take swings. When the first's axe connects with a tree, all of the trees shudder and burst into mist, popping almost like balloons.
#Narration
Beyond, you see the familiar clearing, smoke rising from the home's chimney.
#Barkeep
Strong warding. We'd best be careful as we continue on.
#Narration
You follow after, a strong sinking pit in your stomach.
#Narration
The air is oppressively still in this clearing. The dense forest around it blocks much of the day's fading light.
#Narration
What light there is may just as well be coming from the moon, out full and early in the dimming sky.
#Narration
Your eyes still catch nearly every detail. A fallen branch here, a rustling bush there.
#Narration
The eyes of those with you are not so adept. Even by the torchlight that some carry, the uneven ground here is a tripping hazard.
#Narration
As a result, you've pulled ahead of the group and nearly reached the house yourself when you notice it.
#Narration
The stumbling feet and occasional curses from the group behind you have vanished completely.
#Narration
Your ears swivel, and then your head, but it's too late.
#Narration
The ground, uneven yet stable behind you moments ago has fissured. Jagged and bottomless grooves have swallowed the posse.
#Narration
Some you see hanging on to crumbling ledges and roots. They look to be calling out to you, to each other for help, but no sound reaches your ears.
#Narration
With the barest shudder for such violence, their last remaining handholds and footholds crumble away, as does the ground beneath you.
#Narration
You freeze up as your body pitches downwards. You've dreamt of falling before, but your unconscious mind could not emulate the numb terror filling you now.
#if_Block
goHome == True
#Narration
The moon recedes before your grasping hand as you wordlessly realize you won't be making it home after all.
#if_Block
goHome == False
#Narration
The moon recedes before your grasping hand as you mutter out a silent apology to Aria. You won't be around to soothe her loneliness after all.
