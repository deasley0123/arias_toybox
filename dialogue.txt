It was a rainy Tuesday night.
You came home from work to your small studio apartment, changed into sweatpants, 
grabbed a drink from the fridge and sat on the floor in front of your TV because 
it was more comfortable than your shitty IKEA couch.
You flipped through channels and eventually settled on a network game show you remembered 
watching with your grandmother when you were little.
It's more commercials than content now, so you quickly got bored and started scrolling on your phone.
A friend of yours from high school posted some engagement photos. Another made a pregnancy announcement.
You thought about congratulating them, but you haven't spoken to either of them in years. 
Best case scenario, they would invite you to some celebratory event you couldn't afford to attend.
Besides, you've already called in enough days at work that requesting any more would probably get you fired. 
So instead you drank and kept scrolling, eyes half glazed over.
Eventually you can't keep your eyes open at all anymore. You lean your head back against 
your couch and fall asleep, wishing you could be anyone and anywhere else.
When you open your eyes again, you are no longer in your apartment


Hello? Helloooo? Is anyone in there?
Blink twice if you can hear me!
They're not blinking.
THEY'RE NOT BLINKIN-
Wait, you don't have eyelids.
Uhhh... How about nodding?
Maybe with a little help...
A small hand reaches out to touch your head.
It's warm.
You sit up.
Above you is an unfamiliar ceiling. Pitched wooden beams over a small attic.
Early light streams golden through the window. The morning birdsong is foreign but beautiful.
The walls are strewn with drawings, the uneven floor littered with books and candles.
There is a small, unmade bed in the corner, a disheveled arrangement of sheets and leather tomes.
The owner of which (you assume) peers over her hat at you, uncomfortably close now.
You shift away, and she skitters back.
Hey! You moved! That's great!! It worked!! I'm AMAZING!!!
Where am I? Who are you? What's going on? Why-
You are becoming aware of your body in spurts. Currently seated, your hands support you.
The ground feels tacky to touch, prompting you to really see it... and your hands.
Why is the ground covered in blood? WHY ARE MY HANDS PAWS?!?
I'm Aria! You're my favorite doll!
"Jophiel the Duskborn, catfolk master thief""Right hand of the Weald Queen! Unmatched in the fields of battle AND wits-"
My name is Serena.I'm an Uber driver from Cleveland.
What on Earth are you talking about?
Ah! That's just the thing! You're not on Earth anymore at all!
I've summoned you here, Jophiel, to help me perform a mighty deed.We're going on A QUEST!
AREN'T YOU EXCITED?!
The young girl beams. The blood-drawn ritual circle under you is starting to dry on the raw wood planks.
You make one last futile attempt at normalcy.
Is this... is this some kind of TikTok trend? Is someone filming me right now?
What's a TikTok?
Is it like a clock?? I don't have a clock, silly!
I'm not allowed around time anymore.
...
...
...
You change the subject.
That hat... are you some kind of witch? Assuming any of this is real at all and it's not just a really weird dream.
You had a slice of mushroom and black olive pizza last night, but they were just button mushrooms, right? Not the other kind...?
Ahem. I am a SORCERESS, not a witch!
The hat is for style.
She poses, obviously trying to appear cool.You brush some dust off your knee and stand.
You're a little taller than you were before, probably, although there isn't anything familiar to measure against in here.
Great, so you're a sorceress, and I'm a... toy? A five-foot talking cat?
You feel the pointed ears in your hair and the weight of a long, thin tail stretching out behind you.
Well, Jophiel-
It's Serena.
Hmmmm... That doesn't sound like much of a quest name. 'Serenas" don't really go to do great deeds.
You almost interject about the accomplishments of the famous people on Earth who share your name.
But it's not like you've ever really done anything, personally, so you bite your tongue.
Besides! Didn't you want to be someone else?
Her question is genuine in a way children's questions often are, but your pulse quickens all the same.
What do you mean?
...How did you know that?
Oh.
Well, it's a condition for my spell. I can only summon willing souls. It only works if you don't want to be who or where you are.
I wouldn't want to pull you here if you were happy back home.
Soul magic like that makes me feel icky.
This line of conversation is making you think about yourself more critically than is comfortable.
You change the subject again.
What about my body here, then? Shouldn't I be soft, small, and full of cotton stuffing or something?
Nope! I tried this spell before with lower quality stuff, but... it didn't work out.
I HAD a rocking horse.
Maple Stirrup, you will be remembered.
I didn't really expect it to work with YOU either, but it's probably because Mom made Jophiel for me.
She's a much more powerful Sorceress than me, so you must be made of quality stuff!
As soon as your soul took root, you became big like that!
Wow. Okay. So many questions about that. A lot to unpack there.
You sense an opportunity. If her mother is a powerful sorceress as well, maybe she could fix whatever is going on here and send you home?
So, uh, your mom is around then? I think we might be in need of some parental supervision.
No, Mom is away conducting her research. She's been away for a while. It's just me here while she's gone.
Aria's smile falls away for the first time since you woke. Her clear discomfort around this question gives you pause, but you push ahead regardless.
Oh, well, if she's been away for a while then that must be our quest? Let's go and find your mom!
No, I'm forbidden from interfering with Mom's work.
Oh. Then-
Our quest is something of far greater, far NOBLER importance!
Well, maybe-
Within this forest lies a creature foul and perverse.To battle it is to court danger.To challenge it is foolhardiness personified.
BUT IT MUST BE DONE! THE BOG BEAST MUST BE CAPTURED!
AND IF IT IS NOT BY OUR HAND, THEN BY WHOSE!?
Anyone's! Yours! But not mine! I don't even have hands!?
But I'm not allowed in the forest without supervision.And Mom is never around to supervise me.
But you're an adult. You could supervise me...
This conversation is going nowhere. Or, at least, nowhere you want to go.
Aria, please. I understand you're bored, and maybe a little lonely, but I can't stay here, okay?
I need to go home.
...
I understand.
Okay, good-
If that's what you really want, I will send you home.
I promise.
...
But I can only open a gate between worlds when the borders are thinnest.
You feel a sinking weight in your stomach.
When's that?
Dawn and Dusk.
I can't send you home until tonight.
The weight in your stomach grows.
So, since I can't send you back yet anyways...And I still need adult supervision...
You swallow hard and sigh. Her big eyes look up at you full of hope.When was the last time you looked at anything like that?
Well, I've never been on any quests before. Certainly haven't encountered any bog beasts, so I don't know how much help I'll be.
Even as you're speaking, you recognize that there isn't really a choice here.
You can whine and drag your feet, but the little girl in front of you is powerful enough to summon you from another world, apparently.
If she wants to go on a quest, you're going on a quest. You can't even get her to call you by your actual name.
But first, before any questing, my name-
Jophiel.
Serena.
Jophiel.
...
Jo.
...
So, where is this bog beast anyhow?
The bog beast slumbers in the murk at the heart of this very forest.
So...Maybe 20 minutes?
More like an hour. I've got little legs.
Better get moving then.
With glee, she rushes to the window, throws it open, and lets down her sheets. You realize now that they've already been tied nicely for such a purpose.
Down we go!
We're not gonna use the door?
Mom will know if we go that way! Besides, going out the window is how you always start an adventure!
She throws you one last smile before sliding over the sill and down out of sight.
You sigh once more as you toss your own leg over and look down. The house is only one floor, plus this attic, so it isn't far to go.
Aria waits impatiently on the ground below.
What are you waiting for? Our quest awaits!





The house you were summoned into is a small cottage in a clearing, surrounded on all sides by forest.
You leave it behind, still and silent, after watching Aria magic the bundled sheets back up through her window.
You walk through the brush at first but quickly hit a narrow path.
Aria runs ahead and back, to and fro, eyeing every tree, bush, and rock with profound interest.
Your mind wanders.
The more you walk, the more you're certain you don't feel like a doll. Granted, you've never been a doll before, 
but you're pretty sure even the most carefully made dolls don't have vocal cords, or ears that twitch toward new sounds, 
or tails that swish to keep balance, or stomachs that flip every time the girl in the witch hat rounds a bend out of your sight.
Even your paws... they are paws, complete with retractable claws just like a cat would have. But your... fingers? 
They curl and flex with more dexterity than you'd expect. You have no problem picking up and holding a stick when you try.
Your eyesight is better, too. You could never afford one of those 4K TVs, but you imagine they'd be like this. 
Colors seem brighter, details clearer. You can see and hear every leaf rustling in the breeze. It's a little overwhelming, actually.
Especially as you notice, these trees... they don't look like any trees you've ever seen. 
You're not a nature buff or anything, you doubt you could tell an oak from an aspen, 
but you've never seen leaves shaped like these, or bark that forms in quite this way. 
The forest is still a palette of greens and browns, sunlight filtering through the canopy and 
rippling across the forest floor, but even then... Is the sunlight a little more orange than you remember?
It's the moss on a stone you pass that finally does it. The moss is light purple, 
studded with tiny blooms of the deepest blue you've ever seen in a plant. 
It's the sort of thing you'd expect to see at the bottom of the ocean, or maybe on an alien planet in a video game, 
but not here. You reach out to touch it, and it feels just like moss. 
You scratch some of it off the stone with your dexterous new claws. It falls to the ground in a small clump.
You didn't realize it until now, but some part of you was treating all of this as an extremely vivid dream. 
Even as you settled into this new body. Even as a child explained the rules of soul-summoning. 
Even as you watched that same child do actual magic in front of you, effortlessly levitating those sheets.

Holy shit. This is real. This is actually happening.
Yeah! Isn't it great?
You'd whispered it to yourself, unaware that Aria had ambled her way back to you.
At her voice, you jump slightly. Your tail puffs out as every hair stands on end.
This is the Great Weald where the Queen oversees her realm. Its beauty only tarnished by the darkness that lurks in its deepest depths.
... The Bog Beast?
THE BOG BEAST!
Aria sprints forward again, holding her hat to her head. She stumbles slightly over a root but recovers quickly, readjusting the bag slung over her shoulder.
You glance around again. The trees rustle with another breeze. Slowly, your tail smooths out again.
Do you actually know where we're going?
Yep!
Do you walk out here with your mom sometimes?
No, this is my first time.
Okay. So, then... are you sure you know where we're going? This is, um... the Great Weald, after all. Seems pretty big. Easy to get lost.
It's gigantic! But don't worry, Jophiel. I have this!
She holds up something flat, smooth and slightly teardrop-shaped. As she turns it, it catches a beam of sunlight for a brief moment and reflects it into your eyes.
A mirror?
A magic mirror. It shows anything I ask it to. That's how I've kept track of the bog beast, deep in his murky lair.
That's how I know about your world too. Your people have strange magic.
I like watching the big colorful monsters chase each other around. Why do you let them eat you?
I don't... what? What monsters?
You know, the big shiny ones! They have black feet that roll, and sometimes they beep like weird birds!
And people jump right into their mouths, but I've seen the monsters spit them out too. They're all over the place there.
They even sleep outside your houses at night. Are they your pets?
Are... are you talking about cars?
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Are you a beast-master? Do you and these 'cars' share a special bond?

>>>>>> Uh... no.
Cars aren't beasts, they're not alive.They're just machines.
What's a 'machine'?
It's a tool. A big, complicated tool.
I do drive one for work, but I kind of hate it.
Oh. They seem neat, but maybe that's just through the mirror.
I mean, there are some nice cars. I originally started my job to save for a good one.
But now I think I'd be happiest to never get in a car again.
...Does it stink in their mouth?
They're still not alive....but yes.

>>>>>> Not every car-mancer does, but I'd like to think me and my car have a special bond, yeah.
Really? What's their name?
So, the breed is what's known locally as a 'Prius', which is kind of a thoroughbred for my job.
So, I named him Seabiscuit after this famous racehorse.
Which is funny because he is not fast.But he is efficient! Which counts for something.
Wow. I've never met a horse, but I asked Mom for a tuna one time.
I dug a pit back behind the house and filled it with water.
I thought she'd bring it home alive, but it was already dead. She didn't see much of a difference either way.
I really wanted to see it swim around in the pool I dug, though, so I re-animated it!
I got up early every day to re-apply the spell, but Mom only let me keep it until it started to stink.
I'd love to have my own familiar someday.
A living one, I mean. I'd feed it and take it for walks. Like the tuna!
If it was pretty small, I could probably even keep it in my room with me. Then we could play all day!
Does it get pretty lonely with your mom being gone like she is?
Yeah sometimes she's gone for a really long time.
I used to get pretty bored and hungry, but then I learned how to create food with magic, and eventually Mom gave me my mirror to see the world.
She always says it's too dangerous for me to go out on my own.
So, I'm really glad you're here with me now!It's nice to have someone to talk to.


>>Resume>>> Your chat is cut short by crunching brush. Your ears swivel automatically to the sound.
You hear two sets of feet approaching, one larger, one small.
You have only a moment to stop and marvel at just how much your new ears can tell you before you get their voices too.
No, I'm telling you it's not possible! The gouges are too deep for a bear!
And I'm saying you don't even hang out with bears! I've met some pretty big bears.
I had a nursery mate, a fir, who was the local rub tree for some real grizzly types.
They'd take whole chunks out of him sometimes, but, like, he never gave his safe word or anything, so I think it was all above board.
...was that a pun, Toorg? You know how I feel about puns.
Aw, come on Gerald, I know you've got a sense of humor in there somewhere.
No room. Too much anger, too little body.
The two emerge from the brush, an imposing tree-man and a gnomish sort. Their conversation trails off as they meet your gaze.
Oh!! Greetings fellow travelers! 'Tis fate that must have brought us together.
I am Aria of the Weald Queen's court! And this is Jophiel the Duskborn, catfolk master thi-
It's just Jo. I'm chaperoning this precocious child.
We are bound by venerable purpose.We have set upon a MIGHTY QUEST!
Yeah, so-
WE SEEK TO CAPTURE THE TERRIBLE BOG BEAST! FATED COMPATRIOTS, WILL YOU JOIN US IN THIS QUEST, OR ARE YOU COWARDS?!
Hey, whoa, chill kid. We've got some purpose of our own.
I'd even say it's at least a little venerable too.
Yeah, Toorg and I, we're mercen- Adventurers passing through the Kaistr Weald. We slept at the Beard & Brew in town last night.
Barkeep there said this neck of the woods is pretty dangerous. Some kind of "green-eyed demon" been spotted, folks disappeared.
The town is offering a bounty for the creature, so we're hunting it.
A green-eyed demon?
Wait...I have green eyes!
I'm fearsome!
You must be looking for me!Beware! I will not go quietly.
Aria, have you been disappearing people from the woods?
No...
She says it sadly, like you've knocked the wind from her sails.
While your partner there looks like they're packing some potent scratchers, I don't think you're capable of that kind of damage.
The tree-man gestures to a thick trunk nearby. It's bark has been raked through, leaving deep gouges in the hard wood underneath.
(pouting) I could do it with magic.
It would take you most of a day with an axe to start to do that kind of damage to a tree of that size.
You weren't sure how much to believe about the young girl's childish tale,
but you're starting to worry this Bog Beast business may be more than you bargained for.
Hey, maybe your Bog Beast and this Green-Eyed Demon are the same?
We could use some more hands against such a dangerous foe.
Hmm... more company on our Quest would be grand, but I can't hold my fellow adventurers back from their own.
The Bog Beast doesn't have green eyes, and it has no teeth or claws among its horrors that could do this.
Ah. Great. Of course it doesn't.
Well, the Barkeep didn't mention a bounty for a Bog Beast, anywho.
Best of luck on your Quest, child! We must branch out from here on our own.
Alright, if you've got time to pun you've got time to march.
Let's widen our search for more signs of this demon.
The two of them crunch off through the brush, deeper into the woods.
That was a fun break! But I hope you're ready, Jo!
Soon we shall greet our destined foe!
You swallow hard and step nervously after her.
