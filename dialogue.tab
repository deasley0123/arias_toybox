scene1_e1554201	s	...	game/scene1.rpy	105	s "[what]"
scene1_bb8e4b4e	a	...	game/scene1.rpy	108	a "[what]"
scene1_e1554201_1	s	...	game/scene1.rpy	111	s "[what]"
scene1_3c24c522	n	You change the subject.	game/scene1.rpy	112	n "[what]"
scene1_6c5f3997	s	That hat... are you some kind of witch? Assuming any of this is real at all and it's not just a really weird dream.	game/scene1.rpy	115	s "[what]"
scene1_40943b25	n	You had a slice of mushroom and black olive pizza last night, but they were just button mushrooms, right? Not the other kind...?	game/scene1.rpy	116	n "[what]"
scene1_4fba4cbc	a	Ahem. I am a SORCERESS, not a witch!	game/scene1.rpy	119	a "[what]"

scene1_9fbf3f45	s	It's Serena.	game/scene1.rpy	133	s "[what]"
scene1_e356d796	a	Hmmmm... That doesn't sound like much of a quest name. 'Serenas" don't really go to do great deeds.	game/scene1.rpy	135	a "[what]"

scene1_88df0798	a	Besides! Didn't you want to be someone else?	game/scene1.rpy	140	a "[what]"
scene1_5aa49bec	n	Her question is genuine in a way children's questions often are, but your pulse quickens all the same.	game/scene1.rpy	142	n "[what]"
scene1_49c95ed0	s	What do you mean?	game/scene1.rpy	143	s "[what]"
scene1_265c8fbc	s	...How did you know that?	game/scene1.rpy	144	s "[what]"
scene1_cc80bbe2	a	Oh, it's a condition for my spell. I can only summon willing souls. It only works if you don't want to be who or where you are.	game/scene1.rpy	146	a "[what]"
scene1_82988d6c	a	I wouldn't want to pull you here if you were happy back home.	game/scene1.rpy	148	a "[what]"
scene1_cfafda61	a	Soul magic like that makes me feel icky.	game/scene1.rpy	150	a "[what]"
scene1_894fac31	n	This line of conversation is making you think about yourself more critically than is comfortable.	game/scene1.rpy	152	n "[what]"
scene1_441dd2a5	n	You change the subject again.	game/scene1.rpy	153	n "[what]"
scene1_4fef5e83	s	What about my body here, then? Shouldn't I be soft, small, and full of cotton stuffing or something?	game/scene1.rpy	154	s "[what]"
scene1_62445c34	a	Nope! I tried this spell before with lower quality stuff, but... it didn't work out.	game/scene1.rpy	156	a "[what]"
scene1_7f586bf3	a	I HAD a rocking horse.	game/scene1.rpy	158	a "[what]"
scene1_5aaebccc	a	Maple Stirrup, you will be remembered.	game/scene1.rpy	160	a "[what]"
scene1_1ca501bf	a	I didn't really expect it to work with YOU either, but it's probably because Mom made Jophiel for me.	game/scene1.rpy	162	a "[what]"
scene1_8d602d87	a	She's a much more powerful Sorceress than me, so you must be made of quality stuff!	game/scene1.rpy	164	a "[what]"
scene1_769304e2	a	As soon as your soul took root, you became big like that!	game/scene1.rpy	166	a "[what]"
scene1_0329a5a1	s	Wow. Okay. So many questions about that. A lot to unpack there.	game/scene1.rpy	168	s "[what]"
scene1_9c480927	n	You sense an opportunity. If her mother is a powerful sorceress as well, maybe she could fix whatever is going on here and send you home?	game/scene1.rpy	169	n "[what]"
scene1_2a1d392c	s	So, uh, your mom is around then? I think we might be in need of some parental supervision.	game/scene1.rpy	170	s "[what]"
scene1_0a1b1909	a	No, Mom is away conducting her research. She's been away for a while. It's just me here while she's gone.	game/scene1.rpy	172	a "[what]"
scene1_4afac270	n	Aria's smile falls away for the first time since you woke. Her clear discomfort around this question gives you pause, but you push ahead regardless.	game/scene1.rpy	174	n "[what]"
scene1_bab97d3d	s	Oh, well, if she's been away for a while then that must be our quest? Let's go and find your mom!	game/scene1.rpy	175	s "[what]"
scene1_459f062b	a	No, I'm forbidden from interfering with Mom's work.	game/scene1.rpy	177	a "[what]"
scene1_3401a4b1	s	Oh. Then-	game/scene1.rpy	179	s "[what]"
scene1_28503a4f	a	Our quest is something of far greater, far NOBLER importance!	game/scene1.rpy	181	a "[what]"
scene1_cd3ae210	s	Well, maybe-	game/scene1.rpy	183	s "[what]"
scene1_0dbc8c84	a	Within this forest lies a creature foul and perverse.\nTo battle it is to court danger.\nTo challenge it is foolhardiness personified.	game/scene1.rpy	185	a "[what]"
scene1_0db631bd	a	BUT IT MUST BE DONE! THE BOG BEAST MUST BE CAPTURED!	game/scene1.rpy	187	a "[what]"
scene1_1a3f3859	a_excite	AND IF IT IS NOT BY OUR HAND, THEN BY WHOSE!?	game/scene1.rpy	189	a_excite "[what]"
scene1_64f81348	s	Anyone's! Yours! But not mine! I don't even have hands!?	game/scene1.rpy	191	s "[what]"
scene1_5ac177cb	a	But I'm not allowed in the forest without supervision.	game/scene1.rpy	193	a "[what]"
scene1_3f4f7e58	a	And Mom is never around to supervise me.	game/scene1.rpy	195	a "[what]"
scene1_ce64fd50	a	But you're an adult. You could supervise me...	game/scene1.rpy	197	a "[what]"
scene1_00ccdef8	n	This conversation is going nowhere. Or, at least, nowhere you want to go.	game/scene1.rpy	199	n "[what]"
scene1_39361d86	s	Aria, please. I understand you're bored, and maybe a little lonely, but I can't stay here, okay?	game/scene1.rpy	200	s "[what]"
scene1_06ad8278	s	I need to go home.	game/scene1.rpy	201	s "[what]"
scene1_bb8e4b4e_1	a	...	game/scene1.rpy	203	a "[what]"
scene1_e25ff0c6	a	I understand.	game/scene1.rpy	205	a "[what]"
scene1_c05d3d67	s	Okay, good-	game/scene1.rpy	207	s "[what]"
scene1_f4a0ac66	a	If that's what you really want, I will send you home.	game/scene1.rpy	209	a "[what]"
scene1_ae04431b	a	I promise.	game/scene1.rpy	211	a "[what]"
scene1_bb8e4b4e_2	a	...	game/scene1.rpy	213	a "[what]"
scene1_14270b10	a	But I can only open a gate between worlds when the borders are thinnest.	game/scene1.rpy	215	a "[what]"
scene1_29c167c7	n	You feel a sinking weight in your stomach.	game/scene1.rpy	217	n "[what]"
scene1_e3740e3f	s	When's that?	game/scene1.rpy	218	s "[what]"
scene1_d174a3ec	a	Dawn and Dusk.	game/scene1.rpy	220	a "[what]"
scene1_4c07ac51	a	I can't send you home until tonight.	game/scene1.rpy	222	a "[what]"
scene1_8bac7462	n	The weight in your stomach grows.	game/scene1.rpy	224	n "[what]"
scene1_0ff4e931	a	So, since I can't send you back yet anyways...\nAnd I still need adult supervision...	game/scene1.rpy	226	a "[what]"
scene1_0af40b92	n	You swallow hard and sigh. Her big eyes look up at you full of hope.\nWhen was the last time you looked at anything like that?	game/scene1.rpy	228	n "[what]"
scene1_facf73c5	s	Well, I've never been on any quests before. Certainly haven't encountered any bog beasts, so I don't know how much help I'll be.	game/scene1.rpy	230	s "[what]"
scene1_834a428c	n	Even as you're speaking, you recognize that there isn't really a choice here.	game/scene1.rpy	231	n "[what]"
scene1_b17171a3	n	You can whine and drag your feet, but the little girl in front of you is powerful enough to summon you from another world, apparently.	game/scene1.rpy	232	n "[what]"
scene1_38249b5f	n	If she wants to go on a quest, you're going on a quest. You can't even get her to call you by your actual name.	game/scene1.rpy	233	n "[what]"
scene1_b4769c52	s	But first, before any questing, my name-	game/scene1.rpy	234	s "[what]"
scene1_6666b945	a	Jophiel.	game/scene1.rpy	236	a "[what]"
scene1_fa509e2a	s	Serena.	game/scene1.rpy	238	s "[what]"
scene1_6666b945_1	a	Jophiel.	game/scene1.rpy	240	a "[what]"
scene1_e1554201_2	s	...	game/scene1.rpy	242	s "[what]"
scene1_a6ca6685	s	Jo.	game/scene1.rpy	243	s "[what]"
scene1_bb8e4b4e_3	a	...	game/scene1.rpy	245	a "[what]"
scene1_cd3f74fa	j	So, where is this bog beast anyhow?	game/scene1.rpy	247	j "[what]"
scene1_79f55194	a	The bog beast slumbers in the murk at the heart of this very forest.	game/scene1.rpy	249	a "[what]"
scene1_ef2d0ac1	j	So... Maybe 20 minutes?	game/scene1.rpy	251	j "[what]"
scene1_66721cc3	a	More like an hour. I've got little legs.	game/scene1.rpy	253	a "[what]"
scene1_0c6ee084	n	You consider the young girl in front of you. Her smile reaches her ears.	game/scene1.rpy	255	n "[what]"
scene1_e7e77f3d	n	Even if you had a choice in any of this, you'd have a tough time saying no to those bright green eyes.	game/scene1.rpy	256	n "[what]"
scene1_b2077dec	j	Better get moving then.	game/scene1.rpy	258	j "[what]"
scene1_0bdf403f	n	With glee, she rushes to the window, throws it open, and lets down her sheets. You realize now that they've already been tied nicely for such a purpose.	game/scene1.rpy	259	n "[what]"
scene1_24741031	a	Down we go!	game/scene1.rpy	261	a "[what]"
scene1_2a32a41b	j	We're not gonna use the door?	game/scene1.rpy	263	j "[what]"
scene1_894b7b5e	a	Mom will know if we go that way! Besides, going out the window is how you always start an adventure!	game/scene1.rpy	265	a "[what]"
scene1_a61d53cd	n	She throws you one last smile before sliding over the sill and down out of sight.	game/scene1.rpy	267	n "[what]"
scene1_f0ef11c2	n	You sigh once more as you toss your own leg over and look down. The house is only one floor, plus this attic, so it isn't far to go.	game/scene1.rpy	268	n "[what]"
scene1_ca26bc39	n	Aria is near the forest edge a dozen meters away. She waves you on enthusiastically.	game/scene1.rpy	270	n "[what]"
scene1_40acc4b7	s	Just what have I gotten myself into?	game/scene1.rpy	271	s "[what]"
scene0_a618c3a0	narrator	It was a rainy Tuesday night.	game/scene0.rpy	2	narrator "[what]"
scene0_9118ecb7	narrator	You came home from work to your small studio apartment, changed into sweatpants, grabbed a drink from the fridge and sat on the floor in front of your TV because it was more comfortable than your shitty IKEA couch.	game/scene0.rpy	3	narrator "[what]"
scene0_903794d1	narrator	You flipped through channels and eventually settled on a network game show you remembered watching with your grandmother when you were little.	game/scene0.rpy	8	narrator "[what]"
scene0_a17c32c1	narrator	It's more commercials than content now, so you quickly got bored and started scrolling on your phone.	game/scene0.rpy	13	narrator "[what]"
scene0_b978d5bb	narrator	A friend of yours from high school posted some engagement photos. Another made a pregnancy announcement.	game/scene0.rpy	17	narrator "[what]"
scene0_3fbab9bf	narrator	You thought about congratulating them, but you haven't spoken to either of them in years. Best case scenario, they would invite you to some celebratory event you couldn't afford to attend.	game/scene0.rpy	19	narrator "[what]"
scene0_08f98484	narrator	Besides, you've already called in enough days at work that requesting any more would probably get you fired. So instead you drank and kept scrolling, eyes half glazed over.	game/scene0.rpy	24	narrator "[what]"
scene0_7f59ab0b	narrator	Eventually you can't keep your eyes open at all anymore. You lean your head back against your couch and fall asleep, wishing you could be anyone and anywhere else.	game/scene0.rpy	29	narrator "[what]"
scene0_13b60c4a	n	When you open your eyes again, you are no longer in your apartment	game/scene0.rpy	37	n "[what]"
scene2_4750bfba	n	The house you were summoned into is a small cottage in a clearing, surrounded on all sides by forest.	game/scene2.rpy	4	n "[what]"
scene2_6449eebf	n	You leave it behind, still and silent, after watching Aria magic the bundled sheets back up through her window.	game/scene2.rpy	5	n "[what]"
scene2_22442748	n	You walk through the brush at first but quickly hit a narrow path.	game/scene2.rpy	7	n "[what]"
scene2_5d4dbaca	n	Aria runs ahead and back, to and fro, eyeing every tree, bush, and rock with profound interest.	game/scene2.rpy	9	n "[what]"
scene2_232c6a8f	n	Your mind wanders.	game/scene2.rpy	10	n "[what]"
scene2_0736ea34	narrator	The more you walk, the more you're certain you don't feel like a doll. Granted, you've never been a doll before, but you're pretty sure even the most carefully made dolls don't have vocal cords, or ears that twitch toward new sounds, or tails that swish to keep balance, or stomachs that flip every time the girl in the witch hat rounds a bend out of your sight.	game/scene2.rpy	12	narrator "[what]" with dissolve
scene2_7c219fd9	narrator	Even your paws... they are paws, complete with retractable claws just like a cat would have. But your... fingers? They curl and flex with more dexterity than you'd expect. You have no problem picking up and holding a stick when you try.	game/scene2.rpy	13	narrator "[what]"
scene2_00acb403	narrator	Your eyesight is better, too. You could never afford one of those 4K TVs, but you imagine they'd be like this. Colors seem brighter, details clearer. You can see and hear every leaf rustling in the breeze. It's a little overwhelming, actually.	game/scene2.rpy	14	narrator "[what]"
scene2_e0d24f60	narrator	Especially as you notice, these trees... they don't look like any trees you've ever seen. You're not a nature buff or anything, you doubt you could tell an oak from an aspen, but you've never seen leaves shaped like these, or bark that forms in quite this way. The forest is still a palette of greens and browns, sunlight filtering through the canopy and rippling across the forest floor, but even then... Is the sunlight a little more orange than you remember?	game/scene2.rpy	16	narrator "[what]"
scene2_e25e31c9	narrator	It's the moss on a stone you pass that finally does it. The moss is light purple, studded with tiny blooms of the deepest blue you've ever seen in a plant. It's the sort of thing you'd expect to see at the bottom of the ocean, or maybe on an alien planet in a video game, but not here. You reach out to touch it, and it feels just like moss. You scratch some of it off the stone with your dexterous new claws. It falls to the ground in a small clump.	game/scene2.rpy	17	narrator "[what]"
scene2_4ca7fd68	narrator	\n\n\n\n\nYou didn't realize it until now, but some part of you was treating all of this as an extremely vivid dream.\n\nEven as you settled into this new body.\n\nEven as a child explained the rules of soul-summoning.\n\nEven as you watched that same child do actual magic in front of you, effortlessly levitating those sheets.	game/scene2.rpy	19	narrator "[what]"
scene2_72c22033	j	Holy shit.	game/scene2.rpy	21	j "[what]"
scene2_d6efffef	j	This is real. This is actually happening.	game/scene2.rpy	22	j "[what]"
scene2_b89b422b	a	Yeah! Isn't it great?	game/scene2.rpy	26	a "[what]"
scene2_958c3922	n	You'd whispered it to yourself, unaware that Aria had ambled her way back to you.	game/scene2.rpy	33	n "[what]"
scene2_b77d0e2c	n	At her voice, you jump slightly. Your tail puffs out as every hair stands on end.	game/scene2.rpy	34	n "[what]"
scene2_a9abd271	a	This is the Great Weald where the Queen oversees her realm.	game/scene2.rpy	37	a "[what]"
scene2_4292eaab	a	Its beauty only tarnished by the darkness that lurks in its deepest depths.	game/scene2.rpy	39	a "[what]"
scene2_c8961175	j	... The Bog Beast?	game/scene2.rpy	41	j "[what]"
scene2_a34af196	a	THE BOG BEAST!	game/scene2.rpy	43	a "[what]"
scene2_f9e1bfe5	n	Aria sprints forward again, disappearing from view.	game/scene2.rpy	50	n "[what]"
scene2_1d50ed92	n	You glance around again. The trees rustle with another breeze. Slowly, your tail smooths out again.	game/scene2.rpy	52	n "[what]"
scene2_bfaf2eca	n	Hardly expecting a response, you cup your paws together around your mouth and call out.	game/scene2.rpy	53	n "[what]"
scene2_cf1c361f	j	Do you actually know where we're going?	game/scene2.rpy	54	j "[what]"
scene2_79089b66	a	Yep!	game/scene2.rpy	62	a "[what]"
scene2_32cb142e	j	Shi- uh, geez! Hi, Aria.	game/scene2.rpy	66	j "[what]"

scene2_b0b43c85	a	No, this is my first time.	game/scene2.rpy	69	a "[what]"
scene2_c59b89ee	j	Okay. So, then... are you sure you know where we're going? This is, um... the Great Weald, after all. Seems pretty big. Easy to get lost.	game/scene2.rpy	71	j "[what]"
scene2_44656683	a	It's gigantic!	game/scene2.rpy	76	a "[what]"
scene2_b580acc0	a	But don't worry, Jophiel. I have this!	game/scene2.rpy	82	a "[what]"
scene2_3ae45715	n	She holds up something smooth, ornate, and reflective. As she turns it, it catches a beam of sunlight.	game/scene2.rpy	87	n "[what]"
scene2_84dc5983	j	A mirror?	game/scene2.rpy	88	j "[what]"
scene2_f1b7939e	a	A magic mirror. It shows anything I ask it to. That's how I've kept track of the bog beast, deep in his murky lair.	game/scene2.rpy	90	a "[what]"
scene2_c4df4a37	a	That's how I know about your world too. Your people have strange magic.	game/scene2.rpy	92	a "[what]"
scene2_1d5f005a	a	I like watching the big colorful monsters chase each other around. Why do you let them eat you?	game/scene2.rpy	94	a "[what]"
scene2_7fc3e502	j	I don't... what? What monsters?	game/scene2.rpy	96	j "[what]"
scene2_96e6b61b	a	You know, the big shiny ones! They have black feet that roll, and sometimes they beep like weird birds!	game/scene2.rpy	98	a "[what]"
scene2_53b145e0	a	And people jump right into their mouths, but I've seen the monsters spit them out too. They're all over the place there.	game/scene2.rpy	100	a "[what]"
scene2_29641d40	a	They even sleep outside your houses at night. Are they your pets?	game/scene2.rpy	102	a "[what]"
scene2_d3a8f0cf	j	Are... are you talking about cars?	game/scene2.rpy	104	j "[what]"
scene2_17e2a25b	a	Are you a beast-master? Do you and these 'cars' share a special bond?	game/scene2.rpy	106	a "[what]"
choice_1_1_9f9ebed9	j	Uh... no.	game/scene2.rpy	117	j "[what]"
choice_1_1_e1801e32	j	Cars aren't beasts, they're not alive.\nThey're just machines.	game/scene2.rpy	118	j "[what]"
choice_1_1_6f50e783	a	What's a 'machine'?	game/scene2.rpy	120	a "[what]"
choice_1_1_781a4317	j	It's a tool. A big, complicated tool.	game/scene2.rpy	122	j "[what]"
choice_1_1_b5783daf	j	I do drive one for work, but I kind of hate it.	game/scene2.rpy	123	j "[what]"
choice_1_1_c214a761	a	Oh. They seem neat, but maybe that's just through the mirror.	game/scene2.rpy	125	a "[what]"
choice_1_1_aa6baeb7	j	I mean, there are some nice cars. I originally started my job to save for a good one.	game/scene2.rpy	127	j "[what]"
choice_1_1_7830fdb3	j	But now I think I'd be happiest to never get in a car again.	game/scene2.rpy	128	j "[what]"
choice_1_1_3caa2812	a	...Does it stink in their mouth?	game/scene2.rpy	130	a "[what]"

choice_1_2_073c2513	j	Not every car-mancer does, but I'd like to think me and my car have a special bond, yeah.	game/scene2.rpy	138	j "[what]"
choice_1_2_0a0a2d28	a	Really? What's their name?	game/scene2.rpy	145	a "[what]"
choice_1_2_d3a8d4ab	j	Well, the breed is what's known locally as a 'Prius', which is kind of a thoroughbred for my job.	game/scene2.rpy	149	j "[what]"
choice_1_2_f228408d	j	So, I named him Seabiscuit after this famous racehorse.	game/scene2.rpy	150	j "[what]"
choice_1_2_81a2ad4c	j	Which is funny because he is not fast.	game/scene2.rpy	151	j "[what]"
choice_1_2_79b7cafd	j	But he is efficient! Which counts for something.	game/scene2.rpy	152	j "[what]"
choice_1_2_0e096d36	a	Wow. I've never met a horse, but I asked Mom for a tuna one time.	game/scene2.rpy	154	a "[what]"
choice_1_2_808d078f	j	A tuna? Like, the fish?	game/scene2.rpy	156	j "[what]"
choice_1_2_e0744073	a	Yep! I dug a pit back behind the house and filled it with water.	game/scene2.rpy	158	a "[what]"
choice_1_2_41fb35fe	a	I thought she'd bring it home alive, but it was already dead. She didn't see much of a difference either way.	game/scene2.rpy	160	a "[what]"
choice_1_2_e4e9c9c8	a	I really wanted to see it swim around in the pool I dug, though, so I re-animated it!	game/scene2.rpy	162	a "[what]"
choice_1_2_ca791d24	a	I got up early every day to re-apply the spell, but Mom only let me keep it until it started to stink.	game/scene2.rpy	164	a "[what]"
choice_1_2_9e3f37f2	j	Sounds like one heck of a birthday present.	game/scene2.rpy	166	j "[what]"

choice_1_2_62171be8	s	Oh. Maybe they don't have those here.	game/scene2.rpy	170	s "[what]"
choice_1_2_59604abf	s	In my world, every year, your friends and family celebrate the day you were born.	game/scene2.rpy	171	s "[what]"
choice_1_2_8b1784f6	s	They give you gifts, you might eat a cake together, that kind of thing.	game/scene2.rpy	172	s "[what]"
choice_1_2_ca9990f7	a	Gifts, huh?	game/scene2.rpy	174	a "[what]"
choice_1_2_666d85b1	a	Hmm... I'd love to have my own familiar someday.	game/scene2.rpy	176	a "[what]"
choice_1_2_24877e1c	a	A living one, I mean. I'd feed it and take it for walks.	game/scene2.rpy	178	a "[what]"
choice_1_2_c8eab416	a	Like the tuna!	game/scene2.rpy	180	a "[what]"
choice_1_2_504c38ea	a	If it was pretty small, it could even live in my room with me.	game/scene2.rpy	185	a "[what]"
choice_1_2_91ca0d14	j	Does it get pretty lonely with your mom being gone like she is?	game/scene2.rpy	189	j "[what]"
choice_1_2_66932f90	a	Yeah sometimes she's gone for a really long time.	game/scene2.rpy	194	a "[what]"
choice_1_2_67d869bb	a	I'd get pretty bored and hungry, but eventually I discovered how to create food with magic, and Mom gave me my mirror to see the world.	game/scene2.rpy	196	a "[what]"
choice_1_2_1094a910	a	But she always says it's too dangerous for me to go out on my own.	game/scene2.rpy	198	a "[what]"
choice_1_2_bec3772e	a	So, I'm really glad you're here with me now!	game/scene2.rpy	200	a "[what]"
choice_1_2_e7a6d62d	a	It's nice to have someone to talk to.	game/scene2.rpy	202	a "[what]"
choice_1_2_aba4a0ee	n	She's putting on a brave face, but you can connect with the deep loneliness it's covering.	game/scene2.rpy	205	n "[what]"
choice_1_2_645d5f09	n	You've often felt it yourself. When was the last time you spoke to someone, really?	game/scene2.rpy	206	n "[what]"
resume_1_ae06b3a3	n	Your chat is cut short by crunching brush. Your ears swivel automatically to the sound.	game/scene2.rpy	213	n "[what]"

resume_1_a96184bf	qt	They'd take whole chunks out of him sometimes, but, like, he never gave his safe word or anything, so I think it was all above board.	game/scene2.rpy	219	qt "[what]"
resume_1_9c2df82e	qg	Above BOARD? ...Was that a pun, Toorg? You know how I feel about puns.	game/scene2.rpy	220	qg "[what]"

scene4_5780e8b2	n	You nod seriously, and bite your lip to keep from smiling. You feel for this kid. It took you until your last breakup to finally learn this lesson yourself.	game/scene4.rpy	83	n "[what]"
scene4_8d60e82a	n	You kneel down next to her so that you can look her face to face. You gently place your hands over hers.	game/scene4.rpy	84	n "[what]"
scene4_342f0dbb	j	You can't make anyone stay in your life unless they want to, Aria.	game/scene4.rpy	86	j "[what]"

scene4_f68f2b28	n	She seems to be considering your words.	game/scene4.rpy	91	n "[what]"
scene4_e442da98	j	Now if they want to leave, and you don't let them... well, you know how it feels when you're forced to do something you don't want to do, right?	game/scene4.rpy	92	j "[what]"

resume_2_9c7cbc52	narrator	Like a gash ripped through skin, the trees and underbrush in front of you are slashed and torn apart. Tree trunks lay with clumps of dirt caught in their newly unearthed roots, the leaves on the branches still green where they haven't been shaken off completely.	game/scene4.rpy	205	narrator "[what]"
resume_2_4b3ff2a8	narrator	One of the upturned trees has claw marks like the ones Toorg and Gerald pointed out. Others are hardly recognizable as trees at all.	game/scene4.rpy	207	narrator "[what]"

resume_2_71955456	a	Okay...	game/scene4.rpy	224	a "[what]"
resume_2_77713d4d	n	She sighs, but her stomach rumbles pitifully.	game/scene4.rpy	226	n "[what]"
resume_2_846367bd	n	You glance back as you walk away. You hope you distracted her before she noticed the bag hanging in the branches of the clawed tree.	game/scene4.rpy	228	n "[what]"
resume_2_ca65e684	n	The bag that you're certain Gerald was wearing earlier.	game/scene4.rpy	229	n "[what]"

scene5_2994e8c8	narrator	It sits on the forest-side edge of a small, but respectable village. Thatch, Wood, and plaster homes and businesses dot a mercantile square. Just beyond lies cleared land littered with ripe green and gold crops, swaying in the breeze.	game/scene5.rpy	8	narrator "[what]" with dissolve
scene5_37da189b	narrator	A simple, but wide and well-maintained dirt road snakes through the buildings. It comes from over distant hills and continues off into a different part of the forest. One you haven't spent the better part of your day traipsing through.	game/scene5.rpy	9	narrator "[what]"
scene5_e7f25e01	narrator	You passed a broad sign calling the settlement Woldthwaite. It's a mouthful and you doubt you'll remember it.	game/scene5.rpy	10	narrator "[what]"
scene5_d2f21ee6	j	It's a nice day around supper time.\nWhy it is so empty in here...?	game/scene5.rpy	13	j "[what]"

scene5_b349a740	m	And you're the spittin' image of one who passed through less than a dozen moons ago.	game/scene5.rpy	26	m "[what]"
scene5_3475bd94	m	The Marquis had hired them to map the Kaistr Weald. Something about a land survey and resource bookkeeping.	game/scene5.rpy	27	m "[what]"
scene5_3c79ade9	m	Not the domain of an old keg-head like me!	game/scene5.rpy	28	m "[what]"
scene5_af1b09c3	n	You don't quite know what to make of any of that, but before you can form a question Aria steps forward.	game/scene5.rpy	29	n "[what]"

scene5_42a293f4	a	Upon the conclusion of our GRAND QUEST, our bellies did rumble and our throats did thirst.	game/scene5.rpy	34	a "[what]"
scene5_7b1b2e58	a	WE MUST CELEBRATE WITH A FEAST! AND TANKARDS OF YOUR FINEST MEAD!	game/scene5.rpy	35	a "[what]"
scene5_9e2c8667	j	Please ignore that. She's very excited and also very much shouldn't be given alcohol.	game/scene5.rpy	36	j "[what]"
scene5_b5fe12e1	j	We would love a plate or bowl of whatever you have hot, and a couple glasses of...	game/scene5.rpy	37	j "[what]"

scene5_4efc1087	j	I just saw some cows in those fields, and she's a growing girl.	game/scene5.rpy	41	j "[what]"
scene5_8b6d4c9f	j	And I think she mostly just drinks water made from magic which can't be great for you.	game/scene5.rpy	42	j "[what]"

scene5_a3ed266c	a	But fear not, Jophiel!	game/scene5.rpy	50	a "[what]"
scene5_1bbf7a55	a	I prepared for this.	game/scene5.rpy	51	a "[what]"

scene5_b6a3372f	n	Her eyes flash and the room briefly fills with light. You recoil, but when your eyes stop watering you see a beautiful gem sitting where the rock was.	game/scene5.rpy	53	n "[what]"
scene5_b31f119a	a	Ta-da! Transmutation!	game/scene5.rpy	54	a "[what]"

scene5_8a77439d	j	Ah, no. I suppose when you put it that way...	game/scene5.rpy	60	j "[what]"
scene5_f1949450	n	A meal isn't exactly a sponsorship, and this hastily made gem isn't exactly a spoil of your quest, but you are too hungry to argue.	game/scene5.rpy	61	n "[what]"
scene5_d4ecadf6	n	The barkeep returns with two mugs and fills a couple bowls with a heavenly smelling soup from a warm pot behind the counter.	game/scene5.rpy	62	n "[what]"

scene5_1d5bffc3	j	Really? Being a witch- uh, sorceress and all, I kind of expected you to have a big cauldron at home.	game/scene5.rpy	69	j "[what]"
scene5_3c9fd6b0	j	Figured your mom was the soup type.	game/scene5.rpy	70	j "[what]"
scene5_197bccf6	a	No. Mom used to bring me berries and mushrooms from the forest, but I'm "old enough to make my own food" now.	game/scene5.rpy	71	a "[what]"
scene5_b3eefe0b	a	She says she doesn't have to eat food and I need to grow past this sooner or later, so I've never had a meal like this before.	game/scene5.rpy	72	a "[what]"

choice_3_1_81c0deb8	n	Without realizing it, you'd already molded your life into a shape you could leave at any time.	game/scene5.rpy	110	n "[what]"
choice_3_1_42fdfd9e	n	A break from your rut, maybe even a long one, could be for the best.	game/scene5.rpy	111	n "[what]"
choice_3_1_37d326a8	n	Today hasn't been a relaxing one.	game/scene5.rpy	112	n "[what]"
choice_3_1_9d5f4f42	n	You woke up in a strange place with a strange body and a strange child. Most of the day has been exhausting hiking through dense woods.	game/scene5.rpy	113	n "[what]"
choice_3_1_f30cebd7	n	But it all feels a little less strange now, and you feel... satisfied? Maybe happier, too, than you have in ages.	game/scene5.rpy	114	n "[what]"
choice_3_1_d59c46db	j	You know, I'm not sure I'm in such a rush anymore.	game/scene5.rpy	115	j "[what]"
choice_3_1_27368c6d	j	I could stay for a while.	game/scene5.rpy	116	j "[what]"
choice_3_1_e3984155	a	REALLY?!	game/scene5.rpy	117	a "[what]"
choice_3_1_2081cf23	j	Yeah, really.	game/scene5.rpy	118	j "[what]"
choice_3_1_76739563	j	We should probably make our way back before dark, though.	game/scene5.rpy	119	j "[what]"
choice_3_2_e236f5be	n	You had expected this, to a degree. The thought had even crossed your mind about staying.	game/scene5.rpy	124	n "[what]"
choice_3_2_cc3d23ff	n	But this world, this body, it is all so unfamiliar to you. It isn't home.	game/scene5.rpy	125	n "[what]"
choice_3_2_52cdc7dd	n	While you may be in a bit of a rut back on Earth, visiting here and spending time with Aria has reminded you that truly anything is possible.	game/scene5.rpy	126	n "[what]"
choice_3_2_c3c85120	n	Running away here will not change your life for the better, you have to go back and make those changes for yourself.	game/scene5.rpy	127	n "[what]"
choice_3_2_ae7013b1	n	And maybe you'll fail again, or it won't work out like you hoped. But it will be your life to live, not one that anyone else would make for you.	game/scene5.rpy	128	n "[what]"
choice_3_2_3f6fb31b	n	Resolved, you see the longing in her eyes, and you know what you say next will break her heart a little.	game/scene5.rpy	129	n "[what]"
choice_3_2_c37a8994	n	You also know that life comes with heartbreak as part of the package. You do your best to soften the blow.	game/scene5.rpy	130	n "[what]"
choice_3_2_23cdd3ee	j	Aria, I've really enjoyed today. Together we subdued the mighty Bog Beast!	game/scene5.rpy	131	j "[what]"
choice_3_2_edd1dc4c	j	I was in a rough spot when you pulled me here, but just like [bogbeastname], I have a place I have to return to.	game/scene5.rpy	132	j "[what]"
choice_3_2_0b9d03d3	j	Will you take me home?	game/scene5.rpy	133	j "[what]"
choice_3_2_9fddc8d4	a	Yeah. I can do that.	game/scene5.rpy	134	a "[what]"
resume_3_6b90bf07	n	Before you can stand up to pay or leave, the buckle on Aria's hat begins to glow.	game/scene5.rpy	138	n "[what]"
resume_3_03f26d35	a	Oh, oh, OH! Oh, no.	game/scene5.rpy	139	a "[what]"
resume_3_ad001f10	a	Mom's home.	game/scene5.rpy	140	a "[what]"
resume_3_24ac760c	n	The buckle glows brighter, and with a flash Aria is gone.	game/scene5.rpy	141	n "[what]"
resume_3_2147b72a	j	Uh, Aria? Aria!	game/scene5.rpy	142	j "[what]"
resume_3_3e41985d	m	What in the gods was that? Teleportation?	game/scene5.rpy	143	m "[what]"
resume_3_2a4beb95	j	Uhhh, I'm really not sure. Maybe?	game/scene5.rpy	144	j "[what]"
resume_3_44019b75	j	She is a sorceress. Said her mom was too. Mom lives out in the forest doing some kind of research in the area?	game/scene5.rpy	145	j "[what]"
resume_3_85fb5c73	m	Out in the Weald? Didn't figure anyone lived out there. There's nothing but trees between here and Rimmond.	game/scene5.rpy	146	m "[what]"
resume_3_9d6ad96e	m	The woods have always been dangerous, but the last few years have been fraught with disappearances and strange sightings.	game/scene5.rpy	147	m "[what]"
resume_3_11b301c8	j	Yeah, some Green-Eyed Demon, right?	game/scene5.rpy	148	j "[what]"
resume_3_df0b7bec	j	We met a short guy and a... tree-person? They mentioned something like that.	game/scene5.rpy	149	j "[what]"
resume_3_5e4cfd42	m	Aye. They sent me a message by bluebird earlier.	game/scene5.rpy	150	m "[what]"
resume_3_d4e28743	m	Said they had found a clear set of signs, a trail deeper into the Weald.	game/scene5.rpy	151	m "[what]"
resume_3_c5c9ca2d	m	Never did hear more.	game/scene5.rpy	152	m "[what]"
resume_3_717c903c	m	That's the business the town is discussing in the square.	game/scene5.rpy	153	m "[what]"
resume_3_4b0836f9	m	Talk is, a posse of seasoned hunters and retired knights from the farmholds around here were going to head out before dark.	game/scene5.rpy	154	m "[what]"
resume_3_db152558	m	I intend to close up here and go with them. If that girl and her mother are out there, they may know a thing or two... or be in danger themselves.	game/scene5.rpy	155	m "[what]"
resume_3_0eb3b812	n	Your only ticket home is with Aria or her mom. Whatever the danger, you've got to make it back there tonight.	game/scene5.rpy	157	n "[what]"
resume_3_4b88be61	n	Aria disappearing wasn't a wrinkle you expected when you said you'd stay.	game/scene5.rpy	159	n "[what]"
resume_3_6e2b56c7	n	But if Aria's mom is back and you're going to stick around...	game/scene5.rpy	160	n "[what]"
resume_3_41e4225f	n	Well, it would be good to cover everything with her anyways.	game/scene5.rpy	161	n "[what]"
resume_3_dad0adc9	m	Sounds like you have an idea of where they're living. Care to join our posse tonight?	game/scene5.rpy	163	m "[what]"
choice_4_1_20888a40	j	Yeah, I'd feel better with some company. And I think I could find my way back to her place.	game/scene5.rpy	173	j "[what]"
choice_4_1_2f514355	n	It's true. Perhaps because she summoned you here, you feel a gentle pull to the forest. Towards Aria.	game/scene5.rpy	174	n "[what]"
choice_4_2_0f007400	j	Sorry, I've had a long day and a lot to think about. I'll get there faster on my own.	game/scene5.rpy	179	j "[what]"
choice_4_2_c4b19959	n	The Minotaur eyes you with concern but lets you leave without accosting you further.	game/scene5.rpy	180	n "[what]"
choice_4_2_eadd1bbf	n	Perhaps because she summoned you here, you feel a gentle pull in your chest towards the forest. Towards Aria.	game/scene5.rpy	181	n "[what]"
resume_4_a31931ef	n	More than just the physical, there is an intangible void left by Aria's absence.	game/scene5.rpy	185	n "[what]"
resume_4_cc82792c	n	When she's around, you're pulled along break-neck by her current. Her adventure games, her strange logic.	game/scene5.rpy	186	n "[what]"
resume_4_79fb26ad	n	She has more zest for life in her little finger than you've felt in years.	game/scene5.rpy	187	n "[what]"
resume_4_743e964a	n	With her gone, everything slows, and the unanswered questions of the day resurface in your mind.	game/scene5.rpy	188	n "[what]"
resume_4_b641d0d7	n	Unease sets in as the sun drops lower on the horizon.	game/scene5.rpy	189	n "[what]"
